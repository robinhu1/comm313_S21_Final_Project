## Cracking Open COVID-19 Conspiracies

I first heard crazy conspiracy theories a few months ago regarding where and how COVID-19 started. Everything from bats to freezers to military bases. It was arguably one of the most amusing and intriguing aspects of this entire pandemic. I was not only shocked who was coming up with what but also the proportion of people who actually believed these theories.

As a STEM-y person, I'm going to suspend all of my inclinations towards scientific fact and judgment and look into some of these conspiracy theories objectively. More specifically, the goal of my project is to take a deep dive into how different news sources have covered, if they have, these conspiracy theories since the start of the pandemic.

I utilize data from Lexis Nexis to source my articles from 5 key publication sources, namely the China Daily, NY Times, Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and Hindustan Times. Through frequency, KWIC, keyness, sentiment and other textual analysis methods with Python, I hope to glean some insight into whether these sources differ and if so, how?

A skeleton of this entire project is as follows:
- First there is the data folder, containing raw data, cleaned data, and all exported data used.
- Next, there is the data_analysis folder, that dives into investigating all the data sources from the data folder and additional comparisons.
- Up next is the final_data_story folder which contains the final data story!
- Finally thre is the presentation folder which contains the presentation I gave virtually via Zoom updating my progress in what I would consider the earliest stages of my project.

Feel free to look into any, none, or all of the data--> data analysis ---> final data story folders, preferably in that order, or skip straight to the final data story!

With all that being said, let's look into some COVID-19 conspiracies!

With much excitement,
Robin Hu
