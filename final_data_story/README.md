## Final Data Story: Cracking Open COVID-19 Conspiracies

### **WELCOME!**

This is my final data story presentation folder! In it, you can find the final output of all the data searching, data cleaning, and data analysis. The file name for my data story: **RHu_Final_Data_Story_COMM313_S2021.ipynb**
- The cover image for my final data story is also found in the data_story_presentation folder (titled cover.jpeg). I created my own image for this story!

My data story is a data-science article/blog. It reads like an article and integrates the data-science/coding components throughout the story. The target audience is broad, really anyone who has some sort of social or academic interest in this pandemic, conspiracy theories, text analysis, etc. In this, I investigate how coverage differs and is similar between sources and dive deeper into some contextual understandings and possibilities. 

The story contains relevant visualizations that summarize key points extracted from the data analysis, presented alongside a description of what the data demonstrates and their significance. I hope that the information presented gives you something to ponder as we continue to live through this pandemic!

* Note there is a code_tokens folder with some code I may load in other notebooks. There's also a visualizations notebook with some additional files but do not contain any markdown.

### **So let's dive into some conspiracy theory analysis!
