## Progress presentation for COMM313 Final Project

Hello!

My presentation is included as a noteboook that utilizes the slideshow features inside JupyterHub. It updates on my progress so far and some interesting findings and next steps. I would consider this to be in my earliest stages of the project, so bear with me and definitely head on over to the final data story if you're curious as to how it ends up as a finished product!

In my presentatation, I present my:
- research question
- data source
- initial findings
- next steps

There are also quite a few png files in this folder that were loaded into the presentation as visualizations!
