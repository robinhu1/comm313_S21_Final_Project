    "The interesting cases of imported are \"prevent imported cases\", in terms of minimizing the importing of cases from other countries likely through travel. The use of imported is, for a majority of the time, in the context of coming from outside China. There is also a handful of usages of imported in terms of imported frozen food, which aligns directly with the cold-chain conspiracy theory of the origins of COVID-19. It references frozen seafood, aquatic products, and general imported cold-chain food items. So even if cold-chain is not used as frequently, imported may be a useful proxy and indicator for this conspiracy theory."
