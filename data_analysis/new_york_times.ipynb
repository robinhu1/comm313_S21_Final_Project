    "Of the origin terms, we see the highest for \"Wuhan\" which is to be expected given the numerous contexts that Wuhan can be used in. It is followed by \"market\" and \"origins\". Unsurprisingly, the frequency of laboratory and lab (likely in reference to the lab in China and lab-leak theory) is noticeably high. But what stands out to me the most at this point are the two words that aren't mentioned whatsoever, detrick (in relation to Fort Detrick in the US) and the cold-chain theory."
