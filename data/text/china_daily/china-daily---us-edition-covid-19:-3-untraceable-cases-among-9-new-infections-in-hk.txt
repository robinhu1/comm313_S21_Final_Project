HONG KONG - Hong Kong reported nine new COVID-19 infections on Thursday, including three cases of unknown origin, after two days of clearly identified sources of infection.
The three cases involved an unemployed man, 24, who lived in Tin Shui Wai, a 52-year-old woman who lived and worked in Mong Kok, and a 57-year-old woman who lived in Yau Tong and worked in Kwun Tong, according to the Center for Health Protection.
The new additions brought the city's overall infection tally to 4,993.
From Sept 10 to 16, the city confirmed a total of 83 coronavirus infections, 15 of which were untraceable, representing 18 percent of the total and a decline from 32 percent a week before.
Another three cases reported on Thursday were locally transmitted, involving family members of previously confirmed patients.
The remaining three cases were imported ‚Äì one from Iran and two from the United Kingdom.
As the outbreak waned, Hong Kong has started to cautiously and gradually relax social distancing measures. Starting Friday, more entertainment venues will reopen, including bars, karaoke lounges and amusement parks, and restrictions over restaurants will also be eased.
There are currently 173 COVID-19 patients in the hospitals, with 14 in critical condition.
The temporary community treatment facility set up at AsiaWorld-Expo will suspend its service from Friday after hospitalizing nearly 700 patients since Aug 1, the Hospital Authority said. Facilities inside the exhibition center will be kept in case of future outbreaks.
