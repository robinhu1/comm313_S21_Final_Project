HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor reminded people Tuesday of the dangers of an invisible coronavirus transmission chain in the community, as the government decided to extend its social distancing rules for another week until Oct 1.
The general public and operators of leisure venues that have reopened should not lower their guard, especially when Hong Kong school will resume face-to-face classes on Wednesday, Lam told reporters before attending a weekly Executive Council meeting.
From Sept 15 to 21, the city recorded 67 new COVID-19 infections, seven of which were of unknown origin, the CE said citing health data. Of fresh infections recorded in the past week, two thirds were imported.
Lam said health authorities will soon announce details of further extension of social distancing measures, which includes a ban on public gathering of more than four people at a time.
