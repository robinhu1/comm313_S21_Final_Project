Summary

Thank you for your company today/tonight. It's been a long old ride, but a fun one.

Port Adelaide demand honours for team of the day, but the Knights v Storm clash was my favourite contest, while the return of a proper crowd for Super Rugby Aotearoa brought a lump to my throat.

It's good to have some footy back, isn't it?

Let's do this all again soon. Cheerio!

He's binned for ten minutes for interfering with a play-the-ball, and from the resulting penalty Canberra use their man advantage to kick early in the set and allow the flying Cotric to dive over unopposed in the right corner. A brilliant touchline conversion extends the lead to 8 points.

After all that backs to the wall defence in the opening half the game is slipping away from the Tiges.

Again, it was Smith orchestrating play, timing his pass from dummy half to perfection.

Rugby : But while there's reason to celebrate across the water, Australian rugby is fighting for its life, as Bret Harris reports.

There is speculation Fox Sports initially wanted RA to pay for the broadcast of the domestic Super Rugby competition themselves, but then relented and offered a much reduced deal, which RA had no choice but to accept.

It is understood RA has assured the Super Rugby clubs they will be economically viable for the rest of this year, but what about next year and the year after that?

Whatever deal has been done to enable the game to survive 2020 and the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, it is only the entrée before the main course, which is the next broadcast deal from 2021 to 2025.

NRL: Rabbitohs 32-12 Titans

South Sydney had to beat Gold Coast today and kickstart their 2020 campaign, and they did. Moreover, in doing so they demonstrated how potent their abundance of talented backs could prove as the season progresses. Latrell Mitchell was instrumental from fullback, Dane Gagai snagged a brace on the wing and Adam Reynolds and Cody Walker probed dangerously in the halves.

They didn't have it all their own way though. The Titans had the game on their terms after about the 30-minute mark but they were unable to convert that dominance into points. Instead, some Mitchell magic iced the game late on.

Reynolds continues his superb kicking day with another beauty from the whitewash.

Thought we might end up with another draw in Brisbane this afternoon. Felt a bit sorry for Freo - to feel like you're still in with a chance with a few mins to go makes it hard to lose.

The build up to recommencing play must have been so strange for all players, a win would at least lift their spirits. Lord only knows how Richmond and Collingwood feel with a draw in these strange times.

Speaking of strange times - Fox broadcast in Brisbane: 'In his first game! In a pandemic!' Seriously, anyone would think they were playing in the streets of The Bronx two months ago.

The Dockers nearly snuck it, but they always felt like they were chasing the game once Charlie Cameron caught fire early on. It was another example of how fast these restart rounds are proving. I wonder how long that will last?

But Lewis Hamilton has enhanced his reputation during lockdown, the Englishman becoming increasingly outspoken on issues of race and inequality, as Andrew Lawrence reports.

Given the wide array of sports figures that have engaged in the broader conversation around racial inequality since Floyd's brutal murder, from Michael Jordan to Tiger Woods, doubtless some will be seduced into thinking that Hamilton is just hopping on the bandwagon - or worse: doing it for clout. But the unimpeachable truth is, Hamilton has kept this same energy his whole career. Where Woods runs from race, famously describing himself as "Cablinasian", Hamilton is unequivocal. "I don't wrestle with race at all; I'm black," Hamilton told me when I profiled him for Sports Illustrated during the 2015 United States Grand Prix. "When I arrive here, I don't feel different, but I know I am different." Where Jordan famously "joked" that "Republicans buy sneakers, too" as explanation for not publicly supporting a black mayor's historic Senate campaign in his home state of North Carolina, Hamilton never drives his Merc out of the paddock without first slipping on an outsize, over-colored helmet with the phrase "Still I Rise" scrawled on the back. I wondered, Was that a Maya Angelou shoutout? "Nah, bruv," he quipped, flashing that trademark gapped-tooth smirk. "That's Tupac."

Cricket : We may have heard the last of Geoffrey Boycott's, grandma, auntie and their sticks of rhubarb on a live cricket broadcast after the veteran Englishman was not offered a new contract by the BBC last week. Andy Bull wrote a coruscating column asking why it took Test Match Special so long to cut ties with such a controversial figure.

Boycott is right, it is a surprise he lasted as long at the BBC as he did. A surprise he lasted 22 years after he was convicted of assaulting Margaret Moore. A surprise he lasted nine years after he appeared to make fun of Michael Yardy's mental health on air - "           He must have been reading my comments about his bowling,"           he said when Yardy pulled out of the 2011 World Cup because he was struggling with depression. "I'm sorry he's not good enough at this level." And a surprise he lasted three years after he said he should "black me face" to get the knighthood he was so sure he deserved, because the honour was "handed out like confetti" to West Indian players.

Former teammate and colleague Vic Marks offered some balance.

While some revelled in his bombast about Brexit, the honours system or uncovered wickets, I enjoyed chatting to him about his early days and was increasingly struck by the warmth and respect he showed when recalling some of his peers. Players such as Brian Close and, in the end, Fred Trueman, with whom he had a few fierce arguments over the years, and his old opening partner for England, Bob Barber, who, he gratefully noted, "looked after me at the start". Believe it or not, he has mellowed a bit.

Anyone for tennis? Kevin Mitchell has written about Roger Federer's decision to write off the 2020 ATP Tour season, a move that inevitably raises questions about the future of a man who will be 39 when he next steps on court.

It is Federer's misfortune to be growing old when two of the greatest players of all time, Nadal and Djokovic, seem to have survived their own injury trials and are looking hungry to surpass him in the record books. What is more certain is that Federer will not go quietly. As he reminded us - and as he repeats whenever asked about retirement: "I will be missing my fans and the Tour dearly but I will look forward to seeing everyone back on Tour at the start of the 2021 season."

AFL: QT: Brisbane 4.2 (26) v Fremantle 3.0 (18)  This one took a while to get going but once ex-Docker Lachie Neale opened the scoring with a superb individual effort it eased through the gears. Charlie Cameron already has 2.1 from four touches in a typically livewire showing.

To quote Jonathan Brown, Brisbane Coach "Chris Fagan will be ropable" after a Jarryd Lyons indiscretion saw a free-kick in the centre square reversed and result in Lachie Schultz dribbling through a goal as the siren sounded for quarter-time.

Preamble

Hello everybody - it's good to be back. Settle into your comfiest chair, surround yourself with snacks, and invite the canned crowd noise of a full day of live sport to soundtrack your every move. Welcome to post-lockdown Saturday Sportwatch.

It's been a while, so forgive me if things take a while to whirr into action. There's also only a reduced diet of sport to snack on for the time being, so if you're not a fan of the major footy codes, you might want to find some creative ways of remaining engaged (I'm here for eight hours, so don't think I'm not open to suggestions).

The return of the AFL has captured our attention twice already this week with Collingwood and Richmond conspiring to please absolutely nobody in their low-scoring draw, before            Geelong demonstrated against Hawthorn that with home ground advantage and the stellar trio of Joel Selwood, Gary Ablett, and Patrick Dangerfield on song, they could be a dark horse for this year's premiership.

The action continues today with Brisbane v Fremantle (1.45pm), Carlton v Melbourne (4.35pm), Gold Coast v West Coast (7.40pm), as well as the main event, the Showdown between  Port Adelaide and Adelaide (7.40pm).

The  NRL  seems positively passé by comparison, heading into round five with an increasing sense of normality around the competition. There have already been wins for Manly, New Zealand, and most significantly, Parramatta, with the Eels laying down a marker against the high flying Panthers last night.

Today, South Sydney will be out to put the start of their troubled campaign behind them against whipping boys Gold Coast (3pm). After that it's an all-top-five affair with Melbourne traveling to Newcastle (5.30pm) before Wests host Canberra in prime time (7.30pm).

But that's not all. If you prefer your sport without social distancing, Super RugbyAotearoa is here! Round one of that revised competition begins at  5.05pm  with the Highlanders welcoming the Chiefs to delightful Dunedin.

There's plenty more besides going on, and this isn't going to be a blow-by-blow account of every match, so feel free to divert the conversation wherever you want it to go. It could be the impact of Roger Federer's season-ending knee surgery, the cancelling of Geoffrey Boycott, the A-League now being the only major Australian sport without a TV deal allowing it to restart its season, the return of            professional           golf, snooker, whatever, we're open for business below the line, on Twitter            @JPHowcroft or via email            jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com.

Let's get cracking!

I guess now it's time, that you came back for good.
