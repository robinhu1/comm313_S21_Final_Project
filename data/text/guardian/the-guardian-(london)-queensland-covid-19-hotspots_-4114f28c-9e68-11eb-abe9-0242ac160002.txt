Queensland authorities are fighting to contain a Covid-19 outbreak in the south-east of the state stemming from the Brisbane youth detention centre at Wacol. While no children detained at the centre have yet contracted the virus, workers and their families have created a small community cluster.

To contain the outbreak, Queensland authorities have released a list of hotspots where Covid-positive people visited while infectious.

Those who attended some locations must isolate immediately for 14 days. Others will be contacted by members of the public health team to discuss next steps.

A longer list of potential hotspots has been released, with the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, urging all those who visited to monitor their health closely, and to seek testing and isolate immediately if they develop even the mildest symptoms.

More detailed information is available on the Queensland government website. This list will be updated as more locations are added or removed.

Hotspot locations

All passengers sitting in rows 25 to 29 on flight VA962 from Brisbane to Sydney on 17 August must isolate immediately for 14 days. If they develop symptoms they must get tested.

All other passengers on board the flight should monitor for symptoms.

Public health officials will be also contacting all those who dined at the Jam Pantry cafe in Greenslopes on 16 August between 9.45am and 11am.

Those who attended the cafe outside those hours should monitor for symptoms.

Potential hotspot locations

According to the Queensland government, everyone who attended these locations during the listed time should monitor for Covid symptoms and immediately get tested if they develop.
