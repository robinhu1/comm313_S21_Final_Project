This map shows the location of active cases by hospital and health service region. The map is updated daily and includes all cases, regardless of infection source.

This chart shows the total number of daily cases, split by the source of the infection - including overseas, interstate and local. Cases that are determined to be local infections but have origins unknown, as well as those still under investigation, are put in separate categories.
