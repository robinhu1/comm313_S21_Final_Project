New Zealand to abandon all coronavirus restrictions except border controls

The Guardian's Charlotte Graham-McLay reports:

Hours after New Zealand's health officials announced there were no active cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand for the first time since 28 February, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, announced that her government would abandon all restrictions except border controls from midnight tonight. The removal of all domestic restrictions is happening a couple of days sooner than the government initially flagged it might. From tonight, all remaining rules about physical distancing and gathering sizes will end. "We are ready," Ardern told reporters at a news conference in Wellington that is ongoing. She praised New Zealanders for having "united in unprecedented ways to crush the virus."

New Zealand recorded less than 1,500 cases of Covid-19; 22 people died. But Ardern warned that elimination was not "a point in time," and she was cautious about saying the crisis was over for New Zealand. "We almost certainly see cases here again," she said. "That is not a sign that we have failed; it is a reality of this virus." Strict border controls will remain in place; only New Zealanders and their families are currently allowed to enter the country and must stay in government-run quarantine for a fortnight.

Close ally of Mexican president tests positive for coronavirus

The head of Mexico's Social Security Institute (IMSS), Zoe Robledo, a close aide to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said on Sunday he had tested positive for the coronavirus and would continue to work remotely, Reuters reports. "I want to announce that today I tested positive for Covid-19," Robledo said on Twitter, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

Medical experts would continue to follow his case and check on his contacts, Robledo added. The 41-year-old Robledo is one of the most prominent public figures of the administration, and his announcement may renew concerns that the president is also at risk of contagion. Lopez Obrador has spent the week touring southern Mexico in spite of the fact that coronavirus cases and fatalities have continued to hit new highs in the past few days.

Michael Baker and Nick Wilson, professors of public heath at the University of Otago in New Zealand, outline five ways the country can keep its cases at zero, after it reported on Monday that the last coronavirus patient had recovered:

According to our modelling at the the University of Otago, it is now very likely (well above a 95% chance) New Zealand has completely            eliminated the virus. This is in line with            modelling by our colleagues at Te Punaha Matatini (a research centre based at University of Auckland).

It is also the 17th day since the last new case was reported. New Zealand has a total of 1,154 confirmed cases (combined total of confirmed and probable cases is 1,504) and 22 people have died.

Today's news is an important milestone and a time to celebrate. But as we continue to rebuild the economy, there are several challenges ahead if New Zealand wants to retain its Covid-19-free status while the pandemic continues elsewhere.

It remains important that good science supports the government's risk assessment and management. Below, we recommend several ways people can protect themselves. But we also argue New Zealand needs an urgent overhaul of the health system, including the establishment of a new national public health agency for disease prevention and control.

Australia said on Monday China remains unresponsive to its weeks-long pleas to ease tensions between the two trading partners that escalated after Canberra called for an international enquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. Australia has insisted the call for an independent investigation into the pandemic, which it says most likely originated in a wildlife market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, was not politically targeted at Beijing. China accused Australia of playing "petty tricks" and the Chinese ambassador to Australia warned Chinese consumers could boycott Australian products if Australia pursued the inquiry. China has also since suspended beef imports from four of Australia's largest meat processors and imposed hefty tariffs on imports of barley, although both sides say those moves are unrelated to the spat over the pandemic. Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham, who has been requesting discussions with his Chinese counterpart for weeks, said Beijing has been ignoring Canberra's pleas. "Unfortunately, our requests for a discussion have so far been met negatively," Birmingham told Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) radio on Monday. "That's disappointing." China is by far Australia's biggest export market, taking more than 30% of Australia's exports by value.

Vietnam ratifies free trade deal with EU

Vietnam ratified a free trade agreement with the European Union on Monday that will cut or eliminate 99% of tariffs on goods traded between the Southeast Asian country and the bloc, and provide Vietnam with a much-needed post pandemic boost, Reuters reports.

Deputies in the National Assembly, which nearly always ratifies government proposals, voted by over 94% in favour of the European Union Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). The EVFTA, expected to take effect in July, is the European Union's second deal with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) after Singapore, and one of few with a developing country. The World Bank said in May the EVFTA could boost Vietnam's gross domestic product and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively by 2030 and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty.

Known global cases pass 7 million

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide passed 7 million on Monday, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who rely on official government data.

The current figure stands at 7,006,436.

At least 402,699 people have lost their lives in just over six months of the global pandemic so far.

The US is the worst-affected country, with 1,940,468 confirmed cases and more than a quarter of the world's deaths: 110,503. There are 15 countries with more than 100,000 confirmed cases.

The true death and cases figures are likely to be higher, due to differing testing rates, definitions, time lags and suspected underreporting.

The New York Times reports that as many as 400,000 New York City workers may return to jobs starting Monday, as restrictions are eased into Phase 2 in the city, which is the last part of New York State to meet the criteria for Phase 2:

Exactly 100 days since its first case of coronavirus was confirmed, New York City, which weathered extensive hardship as an epicenter of the worldwide outbreak, is set to take the first tentative steps toward reopening its doors on Monday.

Getting here took the sacrifice of millions of New Yorkers who learned to live radically different lives. More than 205,000 have been infected, and nearly 22,000 have died.

As many as 400,000 workers could begin returning to construction jobs, manufacturing sites and retail stores in the city's first phase of reopening- a surge of normalcy that seemed almost inconceivable several weeks ago, when the city's hospitals were at a breaking point and as many as 800 people were dying from Covid-19 on a single day.

Poland reports virus spike linked to mine

Poland saw a record spike in new confirmed coronavirus cases over the weekend, with most of the hundreds of infections reported by the health ministry linked to a coal mine in the country's south.

The 1,151 new cases - 576 of them registered Saturday and 575 on Sunday - marked the EU country's highest consecutive two-day total thus far.

Nearly two-thirds of those newly infected in Poland, which depends on coal to generate some 80% of its power, are employees of the Zofiowka mine and their family members, according to the health ministry.

Zofiowka, in the city of Jastrzebie-Zdroj, is owned by the state-run JSW mining group - the largest producer of coking coal used in steel production in the European Union.

Poland, a country of 38 million people, has so far reported 26,561 cases of Covid-19, including 1,157 deaths and 12,855 recoveries.

Meanwhile in Australia, the temporary free childcare system will end on 13 July , the government has announced.

The system, introduced at the height of the pandemic, was due to expire in late June, but the government had previously kept the door open to extending it depending on the health and economic situation. In recent times, though, the government had signalled it would expire soon because of increases in childcare attendance.

The education minister, Dan Tehan, said the temporary early childhood education and care relief package had "done its job and would be turned off on 12 July".

As New Zealand declares it has zero remaining cases of coronavirus, Professor Michael Baker, Professor of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington has said in comments provided by the country's Science Media Centre, regarding the expected move to Level 1 restrictions:

It is a real achievement that New Zealand may shortly be moving to Level 1 and removing the remaining physical distancing restrictions. This event, when it happens, is a statement that we have achieved the goal of eliminating the Covid-19 virus from this country.

This is, however, only the first battle in what will be a long-term war against this virus... This risk will rise again in New Zealand as we gradually increase the numbers of incoming travellers. It will also rise during the coming winter when coronaviruses are more transmissible.

Now is also the time to review the national and local response to this pandemic and consider what changes are needed to get us through the next one to two years or longer of this pandemic.

New Zealand has no remaining cases, Arden expected to lift all restrictions

New Zealand has no active diagnosed cases of Covid-19 for the first time since 28 February, health officials say. It has now been 17 days since the country last recorded a new case of the coronavirus. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, is expected to announce in two hours that her government will abandon on Thursday all remaining Covid-19 restrictions on the country except strict border controls, which will remain in place.

Ardern locked down the country on 25 March when case numbers were low, with restrictions gradually easing since. Fewer than 1,500 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in New Zealand, and 22 have died.

New Zealanders have eagerly awaited status reports on the last person confirmed to have the virus, who has been the sole remaining sufferer in New Zealand for the past ten days. In a statement today, the Ministry of Health said the woman - in her 50s and based in Auckland - had recovered.

"The Ministry has been notified by Auckland Regional Public Health that its remaining case has been symptom free for 48 hours and is regarded as recovered," the statement said.

"The person has now been released from isolation."

Japan's economy shrank less than initially estimated in the first quarter but the broad impact from the coronavirus crisis is still expected to send the country deeper into recession, Reuters reports. A series of recent April data including exports, factory output and jobs figures suggested Japan is facing its worst postwar slump in the current quarter as the outbreak forced people to stay at home and businesses to close globally. The world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 2.2% in January-March, revised data showed on Monday, less than the 3.4% contraction indicated in a preliminary reading and compared with a median market forecast of a 2.1% drop. The revised data confirmed Japan had slipped into recession for the first time in four and a half years, after a 7.2% contraction in October-December, pressured by last year's sales tax hike and the US-China trade war. Recessions are defined as two straight quarters of contraction. On quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy contracted 0.6% in the first quarter compared with an initial reading of a 0.9% decline.

UK universities have been told to expect a sharp fall in the number of new international students coming next year, including a loss of up to £460m (US$585m) in income from students from east Asia.

A new survey of international students by the British Council has found that nearly 14,000 fewer students from eight countries - including China, Singapore and Malaysia - are likely to come to the UK in 2020/21 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

The decline of 20% in students from east Asia would amount to a 12% fall in overall international student numbers, causing a £460m loss of income from tuition and living expenses such as accommodation.

On Friday, the kingdom announced a renewed lockdown in the city of Jeddah, gateway to the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, to counter the jump in cases.

The kingdom has said it will continue to suspend the year-round "umrah" pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina over fears of the coronavirus pandemic spreading in Islam's holiest cities.

Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year's hajj, scheduled for the end of July, but have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage.

Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to take part in the hajj, which all Muslims must perform at least once in their lives if able.
