A Covid-19 vaccine is in sight with the announcement that a Pfizer/BioNTech candidate is 90% effective.  The first interim results in large-scale trials show a much better performance than most experts had hoped for and brings into view a potential end to the pandemic. "Today is a great day for science and humanity," said Dr Albert Bourla, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive. The news has been met with excitement and apprehension among other researchers and scientists. The Oxford University Prof Peter Horby, who runs the Recovery Covid drug trial, said it seemed like an important moment: "This news made me smile from ear to ear. Of course we need to see more detail and await the final results, and there is a long, long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment." The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has also warned it was still " very early days " but still released a list of who should get priority for vaccination.

Donald Trump has fired the defense secretary Mark Esper, naming Christopher C Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, as acting secretary.  The move seems to be an effort by Trump to emphasise his presidential powers, as president-elect Joe Biden  launches his transition. Biden has announced a coronavirus taskforce to examine how best to tame the pandemic with the US " still facing a very dark winter ". He said it would be "many months" before the vaccine is "widely available". Biden also noted that 200,000 more Americans could die from coronavirus in the coming months.

Christian Porter was confronted by the then-prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in 2017 over allegations of inappropriate conduct with a young woman in a bar and warned him "the risk of compromise is very real". Turnbull went on to appoint Porter his attorney general a fortnight later, it was revealed on last night's Four Corners program. Porter said the "depiction of interactions in the bar are categorically rejected" in a statement after the broadcast. The program also detailed allegations by a female staffer who said she had an affair in 2017 with the then-human services minister, Alan Tudge, before Turnbull's so-called "bonk ban" was introduced in early 2018. The ABC described "a heady, permissive culture, a culture that can be toxic for women" in the "Canberra bubble".

The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has told the ABC's Q+A that News Corp has become an organisation for "pure propaganda" that has done enormous damage through its promotion of climate change denial. Turnbull clashed with the Australian's editor-at-large, Paul Kelly, over the media organisation's treatment of climate science. Turnbull told the program that News Corp had gone from being an organisation that "tended to lean more right than left to become pure propaganda". "The campaign on climate denial is just staggering and has done enormous damage to the world, to the global need to address global warming," he said.

Australian workers lost $47bn in wages during the first eight months of Covid recession,                     according to an Australian National University study, with workers born overseas and older Australians bearing the brunt of cuts to hours.
