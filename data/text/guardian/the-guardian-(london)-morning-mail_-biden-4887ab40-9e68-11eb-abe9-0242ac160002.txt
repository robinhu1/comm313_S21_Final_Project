Joe Biden says Donald Trump is "part of the problem and accelerates it",                      as heated demonstrations over the police killing of African American man George Floyd continue in the US. It's emerged that attorney general William Barr personally asked for a perimeter around the White House to be extended,            resulting in the forcible removal of peaceful protesters, including the tear gassing of episcopal clergy linked to St John's church where Donald Trump held a photo opportunity. Police have been criticised over their heavy-handed response and            Australia's embassy has raised concern over an apparent assault on a Channel 7 news team.            Millions of people have posted black squares on social media in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, though others say it's reductive. In some cities, police have marched with protestors.            In Sydney, hundreds of people have marched protesting Indigenous deaths in custody and George Floyd's killing.

Recordings of internal meetings of the World Health Organisation show it struggled to get needed information from China during critical early days of the coronavirus pandemic.                      The recordings, obtained by the Associated Press, contradict the WHO's public praise of Beijing's response to the outbreak.            Germany is lifting its travel warning to Europe ; and Greek authorities admit their            too-good-to-be-true travel offer to Australians would breach travel restrictions anyway.

Documents released under Freedom of Information reveal that despite warnings of dire bushfire risks, the federal government's follow-up was sluggish.                      The documents show that while some parts of the bureaucracy were aware by August that the country was facing a horror season, that urgency did not reach their political masters. Most notable was the commonwealth's ad hoc response on aerial firefighting, which was well documented during the fires. Meanwhile            the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements has been told pilots flying water-bombing aircrafts are "consistently tasked too late for fires".

The historian Jenny Hocking says she is "extremely disappointed" that the National Archives of Australia has asserted it has 90 business days to declassify palace letters as ordered by the High Court.                      The correspondence is between the Queen and the governor general John Kerr in the lead up to former prime minister Gough Whitlam's 1975 dismissal.

A Sydney police officer is under investigation after video emerged showing                     him slamming a 16-year-old Indigenous boy face-first onto pavement.                      The constable has been placed on restricted duties.

The Greens say a government promotion for the forestry industry that encourages Australians to "look up at the trees, think about wood" should be taken down after a recent federal court ruling on native forest logging.  The videos aim to promote Australia's logging industry as environmentally sustainable.

A government-ordered inquiry has found death rates from Covid-19 in England have been higher among people of black and Asian origin than any other ethnic group.                      The disease has claimed almost 50,000 lives in the UK since February.

Experts say DNA has helped them piece together fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls,  and determine which texts may have travelled a distance, and how widespread the writings were.

Scott Morrison should use Cook's 250th anniversary to insist Britain return the Gweagal shield,                      writes Paul Daley. The artefact, held by the British Museum, is a symbol of Indigenous survival, resistance and endurance. Rodney Kelly, a sixth-generation descendant of the warrior Cooman, who Cook shot on that day of first contact in 1770, has long been lobbying the museum. He says, "It's at the point now where [Morrison] could make a real difference in getting it back here for good if he wanted to."
