Donald Trump has attacked the top US public health expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, calling him a "disaster"  and claimed that "people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots"  in a conference call to his campaign staff.

Russian military intelligence services were planning a cyber-attack on the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo                     , the UK National Cyber Security Centre has said.

The new evidence is the first indication that Russia was prepared to go as far as to disrupt the Games, from which all Russian competitors had been excluded because of persistent state-sponsored doping offences.

It's time for social media giants to update their guidelines to make room for everyone,  writes Lacey-Jade Christie, after the Australian comedian Celeste Barber's latest parody post on Instagram highlighted the platform's discriminatory algorithm against those who aren't thin, white or cis-gendered.
