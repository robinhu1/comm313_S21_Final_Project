An online dictionary explaining the meanings and origins of more than 45,000 British and Irish surnames is being made accessible to all in the hope that it might help bring families separated by Covid-19 closer together.

For the next week, people will be able to tap into the Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland for free and find out where their surnames - and thus perhaps their ancestors - came from.

If nothing else, it might be a welcome break from the virtual family quizzes and bingo games that have stood in for face-to-face contact so often during lockdown.

Mike Collins, the head of public engagement at the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which is working on the initiative with            Oxford University Press, said people were also being asked to share photos and objects they felt captured their family story.

He said: "This amazing database covers tens of thousands of family names and was made possible by careful and painstaking research over many years. It feels appropriate to give people free access to this searchable database for a week. At a time when many family members are apart, it will help bring people together as they discuss the biographies of their surnames."

The dictionary was compiled by a team of researchers from UWE Bristol. It includes every surname that currently has more than 100 bearers, and all those that had more than 20 bearers in the 1881 census.

Each entry includes details such as variant spellings of the name, an explanation of its origins, including the etymology, lists of early bearers and geographical distribution.

Richard Coates, a professor emeritus of onomastics at            UWE Bristol, who led the research, said he thought it was a "splendid" idea to open it up. "There seems to be perpetual interest in where surnames come from. It can be an excellent way of helping people begin to trace their family histories."

His favourite surname is Twelvetrees. Its origins have nothing to do with a dozen trees but actually began as Wheldrake, a village near York. Over the centuries a "qu" appeared and then it morphed into Twelvetrees, probably as it was misheard by clerks and scribes.

There are dozens of obvious surname links to occupations, such as Smith (a name carried by more than half a million British and Irish people), or to places, such as Leicester, Sutton or Green.

Many began life as nicknames, such as Longbones, Goodfellow and Snow (someone with white hair). There can be a twist in some of the nicknames: Shorts may have earned theirs because they were tall.

The dictionary suggests nearly 40,000 family names are native to Britain and Ireland, while the remainder reflect the diverse languages and cultures of immigrants who have settled since the 16th century.

Farah is an interesting surname, with both an English and Muslim definition. The rare English name Farah is recorded with five bearers in 1881, resident in Middlesex and northern England. It is said to be derived from the northern pronunciation of the much more common Farrer, Middle English for ironworker or blacksmith.

By 2011 there were 1,502 Farahs, almost all thought to be of Muslim origin, for whom the name is based on the Arabic for joy, happiness and delight.

The initiative has been launched to coincide with the UN's International Day of Families on Friday.

Sarah Williams, the editor of Who Do You Think You Are? magazine, said: "Having free access to this huge body of research will delight family historians across the globe."
