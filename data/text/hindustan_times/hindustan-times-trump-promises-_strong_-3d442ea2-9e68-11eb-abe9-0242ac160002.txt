Washington, May 5 -- US President Donald Trump has promised to present a "conclusive" report on the US investigation into China's handling of the Covid-19 outbreak and the actual origin of the coronavirus.

"We're going to be giving a very strong report as to exactly what we think happened. And I think it will be very conclusive," the US president said.

"My opinion is that they (China) made a mistake. They tried to cover it, they tried to put it out, just like a fire," Trump added.

The US has disputed the Chinese government's version of the origin of the virus - from a wet market in Wuhan - and alleged that it came from a virology lab in that city.
