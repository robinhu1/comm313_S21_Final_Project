New Delhi, July 2 -- A Covid-19-positive health worker from Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has urged former Congress president Rahul Gandhi to take up with the government the issue of risk allowance for nurses and doctors as they face health concerns on the frontline of the fight against the outbreak.

"We are exhausted but we are fighting on the frontline without any fear. We will win. You and the government are with us. I have complete faith that we will fight this war against the coronavirus and win. I think you will agree that we are fighting as an army," Vipin Krishnan, who has been working in AIIMS for the past two years, told Gandhi during a video interaction. "Yes, you are a nonviolent army," Gandhi said in his response.

Krishnan was joined by three other Indian origin health workers - Anu Ragnat from New Zealand, Narendra Singh from Australia and Sherlylmol Puravady from the United Kingdom - in sharing their experiences with Gandhi while fighting the pandemic.

The video was released on Wednesday, the National Doctors' Day.

Krishnan, who belongs to Kerala and, along with his wife, is in quarantine after both tested positive for Covid-19, also raised concerns over compensation to the families of the Covid warriors who died while treating patients, saying the government should do something for them.

"Two nurses from south India died in Delhi. One X-ray technician, a retired doctor from AIIMS and a sanitation worker also passed away. However, they are yet to receive the compensation of Rs 1 crore announced by the Delhi government," he said.
