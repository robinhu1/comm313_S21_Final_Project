India, Oct. 3 -- After inaugurating Atal Tunnel in Himachal Pradesh's Rohtang, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a public rally in Solang and said the tunnel will help draw tourists to Himachal Pradesh from all across the world.

As the country is unlocking itself after Covid-19 lockdown, the tourism sector will also start getting back on track soon, the PM said, adding that the state is bound to see a rise in tourist footfall due to the tunnel.

He also took the opportunity to talk about farm laws that were passed in Parliament last month and said that the laws, just like Atal Tunnel, will help small farmers in the long run.

Small farmers who wish to sell their produce in markets far away from their origin would be able to do so with the help of this tunnel, PM Modi said.

"Our country is bound to change for the better. An example of this is the introduction of farm bills. For us, the priority is our farmers, for earlier governments it was elections," PM Modi said.

"Dreams of youth of Himachal Pradesh and all of India are important to us. These developments will help fulfil them. I would like to congratulate the state and the country again for the inauguration of Atal Tunnel," he added.

Along with the inauguration of Atal Tunnel, another decision was taken for the people of Himachal, the PM said, adding that a 66 MW Dhaulasidh Hydro Electric Project in Hamirpur was recently approved. "This project will not only give electricity to the country, it'll also give employment to the youth of Himachal," PM said.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jairam Thakur and Union minister Anurag Thakur also attend the Solang Nala rally.
