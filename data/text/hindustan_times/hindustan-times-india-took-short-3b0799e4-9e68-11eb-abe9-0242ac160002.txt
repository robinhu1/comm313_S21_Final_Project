New Delhi, Jan. 29 -- India's policy response to the coronavirus pandemic was guided by the realisation that gross domestic product (GDP) growth will come back but human lives won't, chief economic adviser (CEA), Krishnamurthy V Subramanian said on Friday. Subramanian's comments came after the Economic Survey was tabled in both the Houses of Parliament by the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

"India's response stemmed from humane principle advocated eloquently in the Mahabharata 'Saving a life that is in jeopardy is the origin of dharma'," Subramanian said. "The policy response which India came up with was mature and a farsighted one. India undertook short-term pain to get long-term gain. The 'V-shaped recovery' makes India a sui generis case in mature policymaking," he said during a press conference.

Subramanian also said that the government's measures, including the nationwide lockdown, prevented 3.7 million cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 100,000 deaths as he dedicated the survey to frontline workers helping the country battle the pandemic. "Early, intense lockdown not only saves more human lives but also enables quicker, better economic recovery," he said.

The Economic Survey has projected that the Indian economy can contract by 7.7% in the current financial year ending on March 31 and the growth could be 11% in the next financial. The contraction in FY21 is mainly due to the coronavirus pandemic and the damage caused by the subsequent countrywide lockdown to contain it.

The survey unveiled two days before the Union Budget is in line with the forecasts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has said it expected the country's GDP to contract by 7.5% in the year ending March 31.
