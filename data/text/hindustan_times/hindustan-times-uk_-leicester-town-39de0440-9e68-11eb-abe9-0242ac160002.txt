London, June 29 -- The town of Leicester in the east Midlands, known as 'Little India' due to its large Indian-origin population, is facing the first local lockdown due to growing Covid-19 cases, even as public places elsewhere in England are due to reopen on July 4.

Health secretary Matt Hancock said there was an outbreak in Leicester, but local mayor Peter Soulsby on Sunday said data was yet to be shared before deciding on the local lockdown.

There was concern over messaging by the Boris Johnson government that continues to caution people about Covid-19, but has also announced reopening of several sectors of the economy.

Home secretary Priti Patel confirmed reports that Leicester could be placed under a lockdown. Claudia Webbe, Labour MP from Leicester East, called for the lockdown due to a "perfect storm" of poverty, positive tests and higher ethnic diversity.
