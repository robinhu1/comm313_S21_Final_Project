Beijing, July 9 -- China on Wednesday criticised the US move to withdraw from the World Health Organization while agreeing to allow a WHO team to visit the country to trace the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The US decision will have grave implications for developing countries, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said.

The United Nations said the US will leave the WHO on July 6, 2021.

On the visit of the WHO team to China, Zhao said, "We came to the basic consensus with the WHO that virus tracing is a scientific issue, which should be carried out under international research and cooperation by scientists."
