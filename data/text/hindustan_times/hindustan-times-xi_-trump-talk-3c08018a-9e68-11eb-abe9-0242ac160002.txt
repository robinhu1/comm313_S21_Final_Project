Beijing, March 28 -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday asked his US counterpart Donald Trump to take "substantive actions" in order to improve bilateral ties as the two countries that are worst-hit by the Covid-19 pandemic continued to trade barbs on the origin of the virus, among other things.

Their phone conversation was heldtook place in the wake of Covid-19 cases in the US surging past China's and Beijing's late- night decision on Thursday to close down its borders to foreigners amid fears of a second wave of infections from abroad. China's decision to ban foreigners from entering the country was preceded by the call to limit incoming international flights to one every week from every country.

The US had at least 85,755 confirmed Covid-19 cases, as compared to 81,340 reported by China's national health commission (NHC).

During the phone call, Xi told Trump that bilateral relations were at a "critical juncture" and both nations stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, adding that cooperation is the only correct choice for them.

According to Chinese state media, Xi "called for joint efforts from both sides to bolster cooperation in areas such as epidemic containment and develop a China-US relationship featuring non-confrontation, non-conflict, mutual respect and win-win cooperation".

"Working together brings both sides benefits, fighting hurts both. Cooperation is the only choice," he said.

"China has always shared information on the Covid-19, including the genetic sequence of the virus...with the World Health Organisation and countries including the US in an open, transparent and responsible manner," the Chinese president said.
