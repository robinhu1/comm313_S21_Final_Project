India, March 12 -- The novel coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the US government's top infectious-disease specialist has said the pathogen is 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu.

More than 126,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 4,624 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

In India, the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 73 as on Thursday morning. The government has suspended most visas including visa-free travel facility extended to Indian-origin foreigners from Friday to 15 April in an effort to stop instances of incoming travellers spreading the infection in the country.
