India, March 21 -- As the number of coronavirus infection in India more than doubled in the last four days to cross 250 while the number of infections across the world rose to over 2,65,000. US President Donald Trump declared coroavirus a major disaster in the state of New York.

Italy recorded the highest toll in a single day on Friday with 627 deaths that took the number of casualties in the country to 4,032. It is so the largest daily rise in absolute terms since the cornavirus hit the country about a month ago.

In Washington, the White House said the United States has reached mutual agreements with Canada and Mexico to restrict non-essential travel across America's northern and southern borders.

In India, 63 fresh cases were reported Friday prompting experts to reiterate that not enough people were being tested and that an undetected spread of coronavirus could overwhelm the country's health care infrastructure.

Many states have announced large-scale shutdowns to stop the outbreak from entering the stage of community transmission which is more dangerous because a person's infection can't be traced to its origin.

Meanwhile, the Lucknow police have lodged an FIR against Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor for allegedly not complying with directives to safeguard against the spread of coronavirus disease after her return from London earlier this month.
