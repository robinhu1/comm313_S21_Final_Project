Three spice blends from Burlap &amp; Barrel were created before the chef died of Covid-19 in March.

Before he died of Covid-19 in March, the popular Indian chef and restaurateur Floyd Cardoz was working with Burlap &amp; Barrel, a Queens spice company that specializes in sustainable, single-origin products, to create a line of masala blends. Thanks to the continuing participation of Barkha Cardoz, his wife, they are now available. In addition to garam masala — the aromatic, complex and somewhat fruity blend that’s fairly well known, there are also a Goan masala that’s fueled with ginger and packs some heat, and a Kashmiri masala, an earthy, ruddy mix with a hot-yet-sweet chile profile. More Floyd Cardoz blends are also in the works; $1 per jar goes to the charity Cookies for Kids’ Cancer.

Floyd Cardoz masalas, $33.99 for three 2.2-ounce jars ($11.99 for one jar), burlapandbarrel.com.
