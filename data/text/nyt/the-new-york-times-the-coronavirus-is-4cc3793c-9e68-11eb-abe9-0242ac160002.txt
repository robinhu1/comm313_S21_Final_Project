Re ''Trump Declares National Emergency'' (nytimes.com, March 13):

The Chinese government detected Covid-19 in December 2019. On the afternoon of March 13, 2020, President Trump announced a state of emergency. After months of near complete inaction, finger pointing and lies, testing is just starting to ramp up. The states have taken more action than the federal government. Whose job is it to identify threats to the American people? Whose job is it to take action in the face of those threats?

If anyone thinks it's partisan to denounce the government for its disgraceful handling of this crisis, I would beg to differ. It's partisan not to. It has failed us.

As a big-time sports fan, I am saddened that many major sporting events and seasons have been canceled or put on hold because of the coronavirus. But there is one sport that I would actually like to see suspended for the duration of this crisis -- the sport of American politics.

I am sick and tired of our leaders treating the people of this country as an audience for their own political battles. One side says it's doing a wonderful job and looks to score points on its decisions. The other side calls its opponents incompetent and says they have no idea what they are doing. To quote the famous line from ''Gone With the Wind,'' ''Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'' Leave the politics at the doorstep.

We've got a problem facing us right now. If there were ever a time that we needed them to stop fighting and forcefully focus on the problem, this is it.

Re ''Trump and Pence Won't Be Tested After Meeting With Infected Brazilian Official'' (nytimes.com, March 12):

Despite having contact with at least two people (and possibly more) who have the coronavirus, the White House issued a statement that President Trump does not need to be tested -- though he later said it was likely he would be. He continues to regularly meet with cabinet officials and military personnel, who then meet with others.

Apart from setting a poor example for our nation by not following recommended isolation guidelines, is he not aware he could be inadvertently infecting the whole upper-level chain of command of our government, including the military? This is neither leadership nor genius.

Re ''Everyone's a Socialist in a Pandemic,'' by Farhad Manjoo (column, March 12):

Ronald Reagan famously said, ''Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.'' Here we are, 40 years later, finally confronting the reality that a robust, government-backed social safety net is not the same thing as government bloat. Sensible social policies are necessary to protect the lives, livelihoods and safety of all Americans.

This need not be labeled ''socialism.'' In fact, it can be argued that the main purpose of safety net protections (like paid sick time or universal health care) is to safeguard capitalism, not to destroy it.

Now that sporting events have been canceled or postponed, there's an opportunity to set up field hospitals in Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden and other such venues. Predictions from the C.D.C. and others indicate that the Covid-19 virus will infect a significant percentage of the population. It has been proven in South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong that early isolation of infected individuals can reduce spread of the virus and decrease mortality.

Our hospitals may be overwhelmed if the numbers are as large as some experts predict. Keeping the infected less sick patients out of the hospitals and isolated for a period of time in temporary field hospitals saves space for critically ill patients in the regular hospitals and decreases risk of exposure to staff and patients.

To all New Yorkers and visitors who care about the survival and longevity of our wonderful cultural organizations: May I suggest that you use your ticket credit from canceled performances to either order tickets for a future performance or to make a donation to nonprofit organizations? Let's show that we can pull together unselfishly to keep this most important part of urban life alive.

Why is no one writing about how to keep this virus travesty from happening again? What is it going to take to permanently close China's live animal markets? Now is the time for intense and sustained international pressure while the Chinese government is embarrassed and defensive about causing this pandemic. Yes, the Chinese have put market restrictions in place, but those restrictions will likely disappear once the crisis passes. The animal markets are the origin story here. Let's keep a light beaming on them.

Now is the perfect time to encourage restaurant managers to deal with an oft-overlooked practice -- waiters delivering beverages to a table with the waiters hands' touching the part of the glass that I am going to touch with my mouth. How to assist with curbing the spread of the coronavirus? Train your waiters.
