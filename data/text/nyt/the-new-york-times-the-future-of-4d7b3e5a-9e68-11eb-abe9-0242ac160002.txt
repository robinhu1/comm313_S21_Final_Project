To Be a Black Girl

By Madison Petaway, 17, Houston

I.I wish I understood what it is like to be a black girl:To know myself like a dictionary definitionTo see something wrong with the worldAnd position yourself in a warrior stance:Hand on hip,Leg cocked,Head tilted,Acrylics pointedReadyTo clap backSnap in a Z formation,Increase my volume for dramatic effectAnd even then I pose no real threat.

The art of literacy is not aggressiveMy whiplash tongue, heard as passive—My own kind and their pat on the backFor never using my race’s dialectOr as my white teacher put it,Never leaving my cultural imprintBlack and brown faces look at me in betrayalSurrender is not the way of a woman of color.I raise my fist to protest,Only to be met with the shaking of hands.Gifted opportunity after opportunityFor never a step outside my mark.I don’t want this “privilege”General Boomer eyes me in disgustRejects my questioningIs enough to realize he’s lost my trust.As if I could choose to shed this skin?Do you know what it’s likeTo want to strangle your tongue?To be at war with yourself?II.Would you believe me, if I told you the closest I’ve ever felt to my own racewas mispronouncing My own name?Madison is easier to learn, its origin to a slave master.Or how I’ve been taught to say “founding father”III.Google search of my surname: PetawayDid you mean: Pearson,No, Peter,No, PerryNo, PettisDid you meanPetway Plantation? (Images)Did you know they were black like you? (Maps)Did you know they were from Alabama?Did you know they moved to North Carolina?Did you forget you have family members in both of those locations?Did you know there are sub-reddits of people looking for people with the surname PetwayBecause white doctors didn’t have the decency to spell our name correctly?There are no dictionaries for words without originsThis is my birthrightAnd it’s not broken—Not worn.So, I wear it.IV.To be a black girl I’ve heardIs synonymous with beautyWith magicBut I feel anything butA throat that spits flames seems more justThan spitting poemsI say to be a black girl is to bring what you can to the fightHand on hip,Pattin’ weave, picking’ fro,Jaw loose.Is to be a black girl.

To Have A Name

August 3rd, 2020

By Alora Young, 17, Nashville

I wonder if a mother’s loveCan be found on the second X chromosomeIf God built a womb as a portal from heaven’s ownIf Eve could have known that womanhood was a powerThat God never wanted to be revealedBut the forbidden fruit sewed Eden into our DNAI wonder if Claudette Colvin knewThat something as simple as refusing toRise could incite something prophesied in negro hymns for centuriesIf she knew her revolutionary movementWould live in the shadow of Rosa Park’s memoryBlack womanhood is being asked to bring gifts toParties you were never invited toIt&#39;s lighting everyone’s candles with the fire alight in youIt’s standing in solidarity with women who didn’t fight for youBecause you know what oppression feels likeAnd I think that God just mightLove like black women do.My great-great grandmother was a slaveShe took thoughts of freedom to her unmarked graveHer daughter stood alongsideSisters for rights that would never be hers in a lifetimeRevolution is imbedded in my bloodlineShe couldn’t have dreamedWhat the next century brought inThe law, in the hands of justice Jane BolinThe first judge in this country to be aBlack womanChanging a future she would never seeEvery vote we cast should honor her memoryCast your ballot like that candle burning withAncestral flameIt is the legacy they fought forLet them see what became of the childrenOf the countryOf the womenWho got the chanceTo have a nameIf words are bullets then your ballot is a semiautomaticIt’s the way your voice can shoot through the silence and the staticIf the sealing of your lips is far more than systematicLook back at all the mothers who wielded their weapons for youThis holiday is an empty promise if we don’t use itTo see there’s more to our missionLook at Atlanta’s linesVoting booths with locked shut doorsBy governors with flimsy spinesMy people who can’t vote fornonviolent crimes committed back in ’99I watch my sister’s best friends go to prisonI watch the boys I saw becomeMen become felons and lose every rightOur ancestors fought forI see pictures of today’s suppressed voters in black and whiteSo people still think this is history.It’s not my tomorrow i’m fighting forIt’s my daughters I’ll stand guard at her doorAs grandma waded in the watersEvery vote is hope that no more of my bloodWill lie in unmarked graves.It’s the hope that my babies will always be calledBy their namesBurn your textbooks if they tell you there’s nothingMore to changeWomen the world has tried to silence are women whoKnow what needs repairShirley Chisholm said if they don’t give you a seat, bring a folding chairFor Black women this privilege has not been here for one hundred yearsBut when it comes to revolution ask Eartha, Angela, we have always beenThe pioneersThe love my great-great grandmother held for me from pasts afarWas strong because it drew its power from and burned just likeThe nearest starFrom Malala to Assata from the classroom to the pollsWomanhood and the sun’s fire reside inside our soulsThat through every electionAnd the world we change in kindThe garden in our bodies will find solace in our mindsAnd the waters that we waded inBring joy in gentler timesThat my daughter has the future eve,And every other mother dreamsThat Eden will be home againAnd America will be redeemed.

Just A Joke

With lines from “Unveiling ‘Warp Speed,’ the White House’s America-First Push for a Coronavirus Vaccine,” by Jon Cohen

By Ava Emhoff, 12, Brooklyn

The first case of CoronaWe didn’t know that it was that badIt’s nothingA funny thing to joke aboutI told myself thiswhen I went to bed at nightIt had been late MarchA good time.Our teachers told us what they thoughtWhat we wanted to hearWhat we needed to hearThey told us we weren’t going to close.It’s just a small thingAnd I believed themThen it came inlike a flood breaking through gatesThe cases went upI didn’t understandHow can it go from one personTo over a millionHow can someone be responsibleFor so much tortureI ignored it at first.One person got it.‘Who cares’ I said‘No big deal’ Everyone saidThen the news stories helpedThey said it was fineAnother fluGiving us comfortDeep down we knew it wasn’t true.It was just too late.I want to take it all back.I want to say goodbye to my friendsI want to go back to school.When will it endWe still do not knowWe want to go outBut we need to be cured“Conventional wisdom is that a vaccine for COVID-19 is at least 1 year away,”All I want to do is go backBack to the food I ate.Back to the floors I stepped on.Back.But we can’t.Because of something that was‘Just a joke’

WHY TASHA WAS BURIED IN A YELLOW COFFIN

By INARI Williams, 18, Chicago

Before she was trapped inside/Before there was darkness/Before there was silence/Before she heard the shoveling of dirt get softer and farther away/Before she heard her mother weep for the first and last time/Before she was lifted onto then lowered by velvet ropes/Before warm hands applied makeup to her cold face/She never wore it/Before the white sheet/Before the red lines tied around trees/Before the boys in blue took their time/Before the fade to black/Before she felt gravity pull her to the ground/Before she dropped her hot crunchy curls and grape pop/Before she heard the bang/Before the grown, male, shadows argued/Before the shadows flash fingers/Before she entered the gas station/Before she passed the church on the corner of her house/Just like she did yesterday and the day before that/Before she walked out the front door forgetting to close the front gate, assuming she’d be right back/Before she yelled up the stairs telling her mother where she was going/Before putting her headphones on right when her mother was about to say what she always said/“Be careful, I love you, and hurry back!”/Before her younger brother asked where you going/Before she replied “none of your business” rolling her eyes giggling/Before her brother asked, “what’s your favorite color?” before heading out the front door/She turned and replied, “it’s the color of life, yellow.”/

My God

By Jacoby Collins, 17, St. Louis

When I was littleMy grandma would tell me stories of an all-powerful GodMy favoriteWas that of NoahHow God destroyed the Earth by waterWashed away the sin of manAnd Left us with the rainbowHis reminder that he would never destroy the Earth againI’m 17 nowAnd I’ve come to learn that my Grandmother’s God is not my ownShe took the all-loving God she told me aboutMolded him to fit the shape of her perspectiveThen forced him on to meBut Granny,Your Godis an all-consuming fireBlistering the bodies of those who dare to disobey himAnd I will not allow myself to be burnedShe tells meThat she prays for me every nightPrays that devil loosens his grip from my mindBecause the cross of a gay grandson is too much for her to bear Her words burn hotter than any hell fire I’ve come to knowAnd I wonder?Does her “all-loving” god fuel her hatred for meThe Bible’s Say: “Whoever lives in love, lives in God, and God in them.”So why when I chose Steven over Eve is my Love corrupted?I tell herYour God is a contradictionHe is confused by his own standardsAnd for thathe has no room in my heartShe saysMine is a bad religionSays the only thing that should bring me to my kneesIs his sonI guess she doesn’t see the irony in thatSo I remind her of NoahWhen the Lord placed a rainbow on the EarthHe said it would never be destroyed againBut nowThat the rainbow is placed in meWhy has it lost it’s significance?I am God’s symbol of peaceI am his reminder that destruction shall no longer walk this landBut he must not have predicted it could manifest in youIt drips off your tongue like venomA toxin so potent that it corrupts mindsPoisons our thoughtsMakes us feel like we have no place in this worldThat our choice of love condemns them to the flame of your God’s judgmentBut I’m here to tell youYour inferno of a God stands no chance against the cool waters of my Lord and SaviorYours wishes to see the world burnAnd wants to write his name in the ashesHe feeds on the fear of his followers and their blind ambition.But this is how your God will failYou seeMy GodHe Is the calm before the stormAnd the raging waters that followHe will wash away the flames of your GodKilling each cinder with cooling watersAnd leaving you drenched in his mercyHe will dilute the poison in all those corrupted mindsHe will tell them not to be afraid to let their rainbow shineBecause their rainbow is a reflection of himAnd that we are all his symbols of peaceGranny this is the God you told me aboutThe God of Noah’s timeWill you Remember him?

Fire Season

By Leila Mottley, 18, Oakland

The smoke in Oakland has hands. We are inside the palm,choking as we feed. The tear gas stings my eyes openmakes me bloodshot, makes me swallow.My street is a war zone and by war zone I meanhunting ground. to be black and girl is to not only fear the slaughterof your body, but to fear the body itself.I watch the men cower at my face. I watch the men sneer as they grope.I watch the men forget what has been done to them, lookat their hands and see only how easy it is to cup them over another’s mouthI smell the coal lingering, I smell their greatest-granddaddy’s master’s breathshowing them how to make a fire from black girl breasts,feel bigger than their noose.My brother will not understand what I mean when I say I am exhaustedof having a face and I cannot distinguish smoke from tear gasfrom fireworks from sirens todayWe are marching down a street that preys on me.We are marching toward the riot gear,toward more men in blue and belts and gas masks who do not have to gulp ashas their zip ties slice my wrists openand they do not worry if I am too young to be this womanSay Her Name morphs at the rally and I am trying to re-remember all the syllablesall the Sandras and Rekias and girlswho don’t make the headlines because they are not deadthey have just been turned inside outtheir lungs a checkerboard of grayrotting meat and the coroner does not know if it is the firesor the traumaSmoke swirls and this does not stop us. The fist has begun to tremorand we cold sweat as we march now,the megaphone repeating again and again I cannot breathe.What if I am choking tooThey stomp on the curbs we were ravaged on and we don’t haveanother choice but to keep marching,keep believing those sounds are firecrackers and not flashbangsor give up, let the hand tighten,let the hand around our throats.

insecure words.

By Akilah Toney, 18, New Orleans

Your prestige dialect needs more seasoning,me adding my own twist does not subtract my sentence reasoning.Twining my Black vernacularlike my aunt’s hips at a family get together,gentrifying my speech.Raising up the prices for “you ain’t”,and moving in “you are not”.Flat ironing my tongue to suit them,combing out my curly vernacular,massaging relaxer through my talk.I kept the burning cream on my gums longerso you could understand me.

I let my accent escape my mouth.

I rhythmize my tongue,with the beat of drums and the stomps of my brown feet.Replace “himself” with “his self”, I put the “be” after I say he or she.Examples like:My people be inventin’ words for survival,orMe and my Niggas be rapping then write 10 page essays the next day,or how aboutI be pimpin’ words and makin’ English my bitch,I move and hypnotize you with words not in your vocabulary.Make my speeches gyrate like they dancin’ to Big Freedia,pronunciate my vowels, let them syncopate with the chatter of my teeth.I pulls ears to my mouth, wrangle them with the wildness of my tongue.And the next time you correct me with red lines under my words,or try to embarrass me and my dialect,Best believe Imma say some shit you ain’t neva heard.

For the murdered black girl

After Sean Patrick Mulroy’s “Sestina for the Murdered Girl”

By Nyarae Francis, 16, Los Angeles

Rain falls on a town as the copper unmarked police carcarries the news we feared, Shanice Silvia is dead.Mother cries out for her baby at the door.Father, parks his redtruck, and sinks into the arms of now childless mother. Neighbors,peer from the blinds, watch her greet him with the news. Shanice,missing for 6 months, Parents printed her face on flyers, handed them out in front of local businesses: ShaniceFlyers taped to cars.Read: African American, brown eyes, black hair. Have you seen me?The police after seven days of searching groaned there’s no evidence of kidnapping just 30 days of running away. 30 days of prayers. 30 days of forgotten.On the news that night they report, Kaitlin gone missing caucasian, green eyes, orange hair, last seen in red.Last seen in newspapers and TV screens, and city searches. Knocking. Everybody’s doorsare open for Kaitlin, But Shanice’s Mother plants her feet in the door-frame, waiting on her baby to run back, say she’s okay and where she’s been, the elephants she saw.Last seen wearing denim shorts and a cookie monster shirt, red.No, it was blue and ripped, her breath a cloud of dust inside a stranger’s car.Poof, like black girl magic, no girl, just missing, have-you-seen-me dead,flyers torn to shreds inside the trash barrels behind neighbors’houses. Sisters, brothers, uncles, wear T-shirts with Shanice’s face on it. Neighborsand strangers light candles, leave stuffed elephants across the street from the doorshe was behind all this time, dead.No more Shanice.Only missing Kaitlin, the whole city searching. Radio Report: Kaitlin is missing have you seen her, alive? Turn down the carstereo hear that, that sound, that thumping like heartbeats fading, the slowing down of vans. The redand Loud Neck cracking open like legendary fruit. The blacker, the berries, the forgotten, remember Kaitlin last seen in redfound sprinting to her mother’s open arms. That sound her feet, that thumping that sometimes wakes the whining neighbors,the way the hits of Shanice’s body tumbling in the back of someone’s carwoke nobody. The sound of black abduction gone woke nobody and no one heard and now all that is empty bedrooms locked doors.Shanice beaten left with a hole in her neck and bleeding from in between her cherry popped legs. Clapping loudly like the slap of bleach hitting the bathroom floors. ShaniceThe name means God is merciful, 60 days and God’s mercy is dead.Found in a motel. No one cares. Shanice only dust on thousands of cases of missing and murdered black girls, and Trans black girls. Only headlined when proven deadShanice Silvia, Dead. Reporters bring cameras and clipboards and it’s too late, they interview police and the neighbors, clutch children they adore and say there’s a hole inside every one of us red-eyed, dead cries and useless guilty neighbors saw nothing behind closed doors.Missing. Have you seen me? Shanice?

justice for -

By Samuel Getachew, 18, Oakland

i tried to write a poem for george. / and breonna. / and tony. / and elijah. and none of them made it past a scribble / past a draft / past the passing thought / that i could leave the name and the details blank / and this would be the same poem / that i’ve been writing since i was 14 years old / and i am so tired / of explaining why i’m tired / of viral videos / and an america that says / that if she does not get to watch a dying man’s last breath / that if she does not get an open casket funeral / a published photograph of the corpse / she cannot say for certain if he lived / or died / so tired / of an america that says / that if she does not get to watch the bullets / enter his heart in real time / or watch his last breath leave his lungs / on cable television / then she cannot be certain that he wasn’t / too loud / or too tall / or too resistant / or cannot be certain / that he did not deserve to die after all / see legend has it / that if you resist your oppression / i mean resist arrest / america will kill you in cold blood / and then turn around / and offer her condolences to the family / offer black squares and kneeling cops / offer apologies from the institution / built on your bones / send your family to a funeral / and then ask why they weren’t present for the political process / continue to build rooms / and name them after you / with no intention of allowing your people inside / i am so tired / of explaining why i’m tired / of yard signs and street murals / of mlk quotes out of the white moderates he fought against / and mlk boulevards / in every state of a union that assassinated him / and in every major city of a country / that will kill you / only to give a teary-eyed eulogy at your burial / with it’s knee still on your children’s necks
