FOOTY fans will be slugged $50 to watch a proposed Kangaroos v All Blacks match on a pay-per-view network, just like a major fight or UFC event.

Promoters need the television sales, worth about $6 million, to pay the NRL and New Zealand Rugby Union $8 million each to take part.

The Main Event-style coverage will face legal issues because free-to-air broadcaster Channel 9 has the rights to all international rugby league. There is also the potential backlash to consider ... the case of many footy fans struggling in the COVID-19 environment to even put food on the table, let alone having to pay to watch an exhibition game.

Even with the pay-per-view sales, it is doubtful the game will go ahead this year.

Promoters also need $6 million from the Queensland government and tourism to meet their budget.

This is highly unlikely with the state's borders closed and the fact the game will not attract interstate or overseas visitors.

Also, the government will only allow maximum crowds of 25,000 at Suncorp. There is more chance of a 2021 fixture, but not necessarily in Brisbane. NSW's new stadiums boss Tony Shepherd is on record as saying he wants to attract more big-time sports to Sydney. He can offer ANZ Stadium and the opportunity to sell 85,000 tickets - 30,000 more than Suncorp. However, the biggest hurdle is the NRL clubs. Many of them believe they have no obligation to release their stars unless it is for State of Origin or international rugby league events.
