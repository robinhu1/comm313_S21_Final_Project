MARKETS Moody's expects damage repair A LEADING ratings agency says Australia's economy will not emerge from the coronavirus pandemic permanently weaker, paving the way for the country to remain one of the few AAA-rated nations.

In a report on Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service said that despite a record contraction in the June quarter, Australia was "unlikely to face a lasting drop in potential growth or weakening in fiscal strength over the longer term".

The vote of confidence from one of the three major international ratings agencies comes as the nation charts a surprisingly brisk path out of the COVID-19 recession.

Moody's said the federal government's "substantial policy response is helping viable companies to survive the related shock to demand and to avoid the destruction of productive capacity".

"Stimulus in response to the coronavirus outbreak does not significantly threaten fiscal strength over the longer term," its report said.

"Rather, the package highlights Australia's flexibility and capacity to use fiscal policy to support its credit profile in a difficult global economic -environment." But Moody's warned that "a major driver of Australia's potential growth rate will be the extent to which productivity growth picks up from the relatively weak levels experienced before the pandemic" - underlining the need for further policy reform as the economy transitions off emergency income support.

A loss of the nation's AAA rating would result in the government having to pay more for its debt.

The update from Moody's came as the Australian sharemarket rallied to be near where it started the year at after Wall Street's blue-chip index reached historic heights.

Australia's key stockmarket benchmark, the ASX 200, broke through 6700 points in early trade on Wednesday before finishing 0.5 per cent stronger at 6683 points - just shy of the 6684.1 points it was at when 2020 began.

On the US market, the Dow Jones index broke through 30,000 points for the first time, underpinned by the trio of successful vaccine trials announced in recent weeks.

Market sentiment was also boosted by outgoing President Donald Trump's decision to co-operate with a transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden.

The ASX has given investors a wild ride in 2020.

It surged in the early months of the year to hit a record close of 7162.5 points in late February.

It then plunged 36 per cent as COVID-19 became a pandemic, then rose steadily as interest rates were slashed and government's across the globe unleashed unprecedented spending.

CommSec analyst James Tao said the ASX 200 had staged "quite a recovery" since late February and was tracking to post its best November in 32 years.
