Rugby star may tackle NRLW The world's best female rugby star, Charlotte Caslick, is considering a temporary switch to rugby league for a chance to play in this year's NRLW competition and State of Origin.

The Sunday Telegraph spotted Charlotte at Sydney Roosters headquarters in Moore Park last week with her manager Josh White. They were in talks with the club's NRLW coach Jamie Feeney.

The Olympic gold medallist from Rio is the star of the Aussie women's sevens team and one of rugby's biggest marketing assets in all forms of the men's and women's games.

The 25-year-old loves rugby union and is still fully committed to next year's Tokyo Olympics, but a crack at league would obviously be of interest.

White - who also manages champion cricketer Ellyse Perry - is in discussions with Rugby Australia regarding Charlotte's contract expiring on August 31 - about a month before the NRLW kickoff.

It is no big secret that rugby union is facing massive financial challenges post COVID-19.

The 25-year-old Queenslander is a playmaker who would be suited at halfback or five-eighth in rugby league.

Her presence would add enormous interest to the NRLW competition that is already growing rapidly in interest and popularity.

White hopes to have her future settled in the next few weeks. "If she was able to jump across to the NRLW this season, it would obviously be a great opportunity for an athlete of Charlotte's calibre to test herself against the best in women's NRL," White said. "Her passion is rugby but she has always followed rugby league and the North Queensland Cowboys."
