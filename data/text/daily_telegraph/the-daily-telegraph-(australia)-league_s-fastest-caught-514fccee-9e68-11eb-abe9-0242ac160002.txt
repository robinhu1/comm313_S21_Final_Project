THE fines just keep on coming for troubled Melbourne Storm winger Josh Addo-Carr.

On Tuesday, while he was driving home to Sydney from his Taree camping trip, Addo-Carr got pinched by the highway patrol for speeding on the Pacific Hwy near Nabiac.

We're told he was between 10 and 20km/h over the limit. Hard to believe, but true.

This follows the $1000 fine on Monday for failing to comply with social distancing laws; a $50,000 fine from the NRL on Tuesday for the breach ($30,000 suspended); as well as being charged with a firearms offence on Tuesday afternoon.

It was a shocking few days for the representative winger, who is now struggling to keep his place in both the NSW State of Origin team and the Kangaroos after losing the confidence and respect of Blues coach Brad Fittler and Australian coach Mal Meninga.

Still, Melbourne Storm are standing by him.

Your columnist spoke to Craig Bellamy on Thursday, who vowed to support the winger.

"What I can't work out is that if you knew you were doing the wrong thing, there's no way you'd put a photo out on social media," Bellamy said.

"The rules have been pushed hard but it's like he didn't understand the importance."

Rapana rejoins Green Machine NEW Zealand Test winger Jordan Rapana is back at the Canberra Raiders for the remainder of the NRL season.
