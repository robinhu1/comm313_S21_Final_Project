In March last year, then-US President Donald Trump was asked why he referred to the China virus as the China virus.

"Because it comes from China," Trump replied. "That's why. I want to be accurate." Accuracy is less important, however, to President Joe Biden. Trump's successor has decided that references to the coronavirus's site of origin puts "Asian-American and Pacific Islander persons, families, communities and businesses at risk".

And so Biden has banned use of the phrase "China virus" by government representatives.

"The federal government must recognise that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders," Biden announced, "including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic -location of its origin." Presumably Biden will also outlaw the term "UK variant" to describe a mutated form of the coronavirus. He may also need to correct New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who labels COVID as a "European virus". Obsessive worry over racial issues is an American disease.
