TRADE tensions between China and Australia continue to ramp up with China threatening to slap tariffs on Australian barley - a move that could rip hundreds of millions of dollars from farmers.

The escalation came following calls by the Morrison government for an independent review into the origins of COVID-19.

Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said it was "deeply concerning". "We see no basis upon which the application of duties on to Australian barley producers in response to allegations of dumping or subsidisation could possibly be justified," he said.

China's Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye recently threatened that Australia would be hit with economic sanctions if Prime Minister Scott Morrison continued his push for the international inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.

An investigation has been underway in China for 18 months, looking into claims of dumping or subsidisation of Australian barley imports to China.

Minister Birmingham said there was "no basis" to the claim.He said he would be concerned if China was manipulating or incorrectly using anti-dumping laws, designed to stop imports that have been priced below fair market value.
