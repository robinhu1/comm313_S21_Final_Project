NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro says the NRL must suspend any player who breaches the COVID-19 health guidelines between now and May 28, warning: "If it happens in the season, the competition will get shut down." A key player in the Project Apollo relaunch, Barilaro has revealed the NSW government will recommend to ARLC chairman Peter -V'landys that he suspend any player who breaches distancing protocols during their -second 'pre-season'.

The Deputy Premier also said he would suspend Penrith No.7 Nathan Cleary for the rest of the season after having twice fronted the NRL -Integrity Unit this week.

While Cleary was not fined by NSW Police for having a group of women inside his home, Barilaro said the fact the NSW Origin star failed to initially disclose several social media videos that were eventually aired represented "broken trust".

It is understood the NRL could announce further -sanctions against Cleary today."If the NRL competition gets signed off, the cost of any (social distancing) breach after May 28 will be significant," Barilaro told The Daily Telegraph. "And I'm not talking financial cost. If a player breaches guidelines once the competition starts, it will get shut down. It's that simple."
