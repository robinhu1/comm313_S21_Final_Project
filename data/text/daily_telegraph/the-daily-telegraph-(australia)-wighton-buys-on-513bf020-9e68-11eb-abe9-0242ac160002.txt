The NRL's strict COVID-19 bubble requirements this season meant the usually plentiful off-field pro-perty movements of star players were limited.

Listings and sales remained scarce although the Dally M Medal winner and NSW Origin player Jack Wighton and his partner Monisha Lew-Fatt made a mid-season play when they bought their first home -together.

There's plenty of space for the couple on the 3ha estate at Bywong, in the NSW Southern Tablelands. It was marketed as a holiday at home, with the -potential to ride horses and bikes, camp, fish, catch yabbies and play cricket.

The 1970s renovated home that has six bedrooms, three bathrooms, two living areas and two outside entertaining areas cost around $1.1 million.

Having grown up in Orange, Wighton, 27, made his debut for the Raiders in 2012 and has played 172 games since, scoring 54 tries.

Back in Sydney Parramatta Eels playmaker Mitch Moses turned his attention to his real estate portfolio three times this year including in the weeks following the end of season. He offloaded his former Epping home earlier this month.

The Winifred Ave property only hit the listing websites for a handful of days before being sold. He was asking $1.9 million. Moses paid $1,375,000 for the three-bedroom home in 2015 when he was at the Tigers.

Back in April Moses spent $1.8 million on a 1940s home in Gladesville, buying back into the area having also sold -quietly in Ryde for $2,099,000 in February.

Sydney Rooster Jake Friend recently accepted a $1.58 million offer on his Randwick investment. Coming with city skyline views from its Frenchmans Rd vantage point, Friend bought it for $1.32 million in 2017.
