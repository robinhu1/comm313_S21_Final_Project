THE COVID-19 lockdown is set to deliver an unexpected bonus to NSW's premier club competition with Waratahs players to feature in this year's revamped Shute Shield competition and be available for two State of Origin-style representative fixtures.

Availability will depend on how the international season shapes up but with the domestic Australian Super Rugby competition finishing on September 19 and the first Wallabies Test of the year not expected until October 3 or 10, some, if not all, of the state's best players will be back playing club rugby before the end of the year.

Waratahs players are currently banned from training with clubs under the agreed biosecurity measures to ensure Super rugby goes ahead next month but Sydney Rugby Union president Phil Parsons expects the stars will be allowed to return later in the season.

"There's no doubt that we're going to see many of the Waratahs turning out for their clubs at the end of our season, which is just going to be fantastic for the game and the competition," Parsons told The Saturday Telegraph.

"There's every chance you might even see Michael Hooper running out for Manly." Both Penrith and Newcastle have been added to the 13-team Shute Shield competition this season, which will kick off on Saturday July 18 and be played over 13 rounds, followed by a three-week finals series culminating with the grand final to be played under lights on October 31.

If the Waratahs don't make the playoffs, players could be available for Shute Shield as early as round eight while, if NSW makes the final, their latest return would be round 11.

Either way, their return to club rugby would be a massive boost for a competition that has enjoyed a huge resurgence of interest as fans who have become increasingly disillusioned with the professional game return to grassroots. Parsons said talks were continuing about a broadcast deal for the season and he was optimistic of a good deal, while it can be revealed officials are also looking at adding two representative matches for Shute Shield players - a city v country fixture and a country of origin match between Pacific Island heritage players and the rest of the world.
