POWDERFINGER'S John 'JC' Collins is starting a celebrity-led campaign against the "unfair" Annastacia Palaszczuk.

The bassist for the Brisbane band, who now owns The Triffid and Fortitude Music Hall, said it is crazy that venues and the thousands of workers and subcontractors they support are battling for survival while sporting events enjoy capacity crowds.

He is recruiting muso mates and sports stars for a campaign called Play Fair to shine a spotlight on the "unfairness".

"This is not about making money, it's about survival," Collins said. "We need help. Once JobKeeper ends, we don't know what's going to happen." Collins said that with the -widespread relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, many people assumed music venues were back to normal.

"People think we're back fully open but we're not, far from it - we're still only operating at 30 per cent capacity," he said.

"It seems like a big contradiction when you've got capacity crowds for events like State of Origin and the (AFL) grand final at the Gabba, and almost 30,000 people at Suncorp Stadium for the Broncos season-opener last weekend," he said. "It doesn't look like there's much empathy for us."
