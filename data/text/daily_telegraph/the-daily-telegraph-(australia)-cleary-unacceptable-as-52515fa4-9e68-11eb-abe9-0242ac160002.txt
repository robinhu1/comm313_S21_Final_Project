THERE is a huge problem at the Penrith Panthers over their million-dollar halfback Nathan Cleary and the fact no one wants to do anything about his recent behaviour.

Not only did he break COVID-19 protocols but then, lied and misled an NRL integrity unit inquiry. Over the weekend I tried to put questions to his father and coach, Ivan Cleary, via this text message: "Hi Ivan, I am trying to contact you to ask the following questions. "Will you remove Nathan from the leadership group?

"Are you disappointed that he misled the NRL integrity unit? "Have you spoken to Nathan about his leadership responsibilities? "Do you agree his actions are setting a poor example to your less experienced players?

"Is it harder having to handle a disciplinary issue like this one with your son, rather than another player?

"Do you agree with Brad Fittler in that it will harm his chances of playing Origin?

"I would appreciate a response at your earliest convenience. Thank you, Phil." There was no reply. He couldn't be bothered. No explanation required. Earlier I had spoken to chief executive Brian Fletcher. At least he picked up the phone.

However, he said any disciplinary action was not his responsibility: "We're waiting on the NRL to tidy it up and see where we land." I asked Fletcher if he would sack the 22-year-old halfback from the leadership group.

"That decision will be up to Ivan and the coaches," he said. "They'll make a recommendation and it will come back to the board to make the decision.

"At the end of the day he hasn't murdered anyone. He's normally got a sensible head on him, he interviews well and he's polite. He's just got to think better."Maybe Penrith, as a club, needs to think better too and stop the mollycoddling of their star players.
