IS China changing its tune?

Where once Beijing belted out the punchy 1980s dance hit "When Two Tribes Go to War", now it is cooing the 1970s pop-funk anthem, "Why Can't We Be Friends".

In an extraordinary address to the National Press Club on Wednesday, China's deputy head of mission at their -embassy in Canberra, Wang Xining, made a number of bold claims that seemed to seek to recast relations.

Among them: That Beijing "respects Australia's sovereignty", that the Chinese were personally hurt by Australia's push for investigation into the origins of COVID-19, and that "cold hearts and dark minds" should not cast a "shadow" over our relationship.

He even compared the relationship to a marriage, saying: "While a rift between husband and wife hurts one family, a rift between two countries hurts millions." It's all quite something to hear from a senior Chinese diplomat, given that the official Beijing line, as amplified by state media, until recently was that Australia was nothing more than "chewing gum stuck on the sole of our shoes".

If this is a marriage, it's not a healthy one. No partnership where one side alternates -unpredictably between acting the bully and wanting to kiss and make up can be.

And in considering China's bluster, it is also worth considering the bluff. Beijing likes to act as though it holds all the cards and that its rise is inevitable - so we'd better get on board or get steamrolled.

But historic flooding in China and worries about the Three Gorges Dam have highlighted the country's infrastructure and food security issues.

And revelations about their infiltration of Australian universities suggests that the communist state knows that it cannot innovate, and therefore must steal, new technologies. Those hoping that this might be a reset, and that China may be seeking to tone things down, should watch for actions - and not just words.
