QUEENSLAND coach Kevin Walters says the series opener in Adelaide is likely to be axed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

State of Origin was scheduled to make its debut in South Australia for Game One on June 3 - a series launch was even held in Adelaide last month - but Walters believes the COVID-19 outbreak will force the event to be delayed.

The possible axing of Origin from Adelaide Oval would be a crushing promotional blow, with Walters suggesting all three games could be held in Sydney in October - scuppering the end-of-season Kangaroo tour.

"I think given the current climate, where the game is at, they will have to move it from Adelaide," Walters said.

"Certainly June 3 was game one ... it won't happen in Adelaide. So if it does happen, some suggestions have been all three games in Sydney with no crowds, but Origin will make it on TV screens around the world which will be a huge boost for the game.

"There's every chance of playing in front of empty stands and it's my thoughts that Origin will go ahead, that's just my personal opinion, but when it will be scheduled, I don't know.

"I think if Origin had to be played in October, we would go ahead and do that, that's best for the game."Walters told The Daily Telegraph he had been in talks with the QRL about the impact of COVID-19 on State of Origin. NRL hierarchy are investigating a number of options including the series being pushed back three months. "I'm confident State of Origin will happen this year but we have to make sure the health of safety of everyone is first and foremost," Walters said.
