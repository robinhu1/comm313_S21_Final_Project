ABOUT 90 per cent of Victoria's COVID-19 cases are likely traceable back to one family who quarantined at Melbourne's Rydges Hotel, an inquiry has heard.

But precisely how the virus -escaped from hotel quarantine -remains a mystery, with investigators unable to pinpoint the -moment of transmission.

The remaining cases in the state are likely connected to -another quarantine hotel, the Stamford Plaza, an expert says, with 99 per cent of all current cases linked to the bungled hotel quarantine program.

The family of four returned to Australia on May 9 and entered quarantine. After they all developed symptoms they were moved to the Rydges Hotel on Swanston St on May 15.

Giving evidence to the Melbourne hotel quarantine inquiry on Tuesday, epidemiologist Dr Charles Alpren said that on May 25 three staff members developed symptoms and were diagnosed with COVID-19.

He believes the three people -included both staff at Rydges and external contractors.

The family did not leave the hotel during their stay and were supervised when outside their room. The Stamford Plaza outbreak has two origins, one man and a couple who quarantined there.
