ADELAIDE is set to be confirmed as the destination for the opening game of the State of Origin series and, for the first time, the sides may fly in and fly out on game day.

Officials from Queensland and NSW met with NRL and biosecurity experts on Friday as they began planning for the series. It is understood the NRL is still committed to playing the first game in Adelaide, although that will require negotiations with the SA government over protocols for the clash, as well as what size crowd will be allowed.

The states also need to finalise talks with the players' union over squad sizes and pay packets. The initial thought was that each state could select a squad of up to 24 players, although there are concerns even that may not be enough given the NRL's injury rate this season. The players also need to agree to pay packets. Origin players have traditionally received $30,000 a game but that figure will be slashed due to the fallout from COVID-19.

Sides usually spend the days leading into Origin promoting the game. But due to government protocols, they may have to fly in on the day of the game and depart immediately after. - THE AUSTRALIAN
