ROOSTERS recruit Josh Morris says NRL players could be forced back into the workforce following the COVID-19 pandemic, admitting: "Ending up on the tools this year is a very real prospect." With the NRL competition suspended indefinitely, it now appears certain that everyone involved in elite rugby league - including some 480 players - are going to be forced into taking pay cuts.

Speaking on Triple M early yesterday, Morris conceded that with no end date on the code's shutdown, even senior players like himself could be forced back into the workforce.

Quizzed on the impact the game's shutdown could have on players, Morris replied: "For myself, I've played the game long enough to have some money put away.

"But I also have mortgages that I have to pay as well.

"I'm doing a carpentry course at TAFE at the moment and could end up on the tools at the end of the year, it's a very real prospect." Despite starting the year with Cronulla, Morris had only this week switched to the Roosters, where he was preparing for his first game with the Chooks alongside twin brother Brett.

The 33-year-old centre, who boasts six Tests for Australia and 15 Origins with NSW, revealed the shutdown came only hours into his first day at Roosters HQ.

"I had a pretty long day getting to know all the boys," Morris said of his Monday arrival. "Then at 5.30pm last night we had a meeting and got told the season was being suspended.

"We are just waiting on advice from the head and obviously the club to see what to do.

"Like everyone we will probably be in isolation of some sort."Morris also told Triple M that he was particularly concerned for those younger players "living month-to-month on their pay cheque".
