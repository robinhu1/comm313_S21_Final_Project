WUHAN THE Lantern Festival is the first significant feast after Chinese New Year and traditionally filled with light and laughter.

And there was plenty of lights and laughter going on in Wuhan, the origin city for the world's devastating COVID-19 pandemic.

But, while most of the rest of the world can only hold virtual festivals, with no community transmission since May 2020, Wuhan was able to hold a wonderful Lantern Festival. Residents packed into the Expo Gardens to appreciate the wonderful Chinese lanterns and enjoy traditional yuanxiao (rice balls stuffed with different fillings).
