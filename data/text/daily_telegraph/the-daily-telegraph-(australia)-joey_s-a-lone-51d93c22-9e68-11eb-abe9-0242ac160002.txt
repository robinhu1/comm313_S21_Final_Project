IF you can play in a grand final while nursing a punctured lung then taking on some wild surf at Bronte Beach is child's play.

Rugby league's eighth Immortal, Andrew Johns, was the lone surfer prepared to hit the waves as huge swells pounded the beach yesterday.

Johns might have drawn on some expert knowledge to take on the rough stuff - he is good mates with surfing legends Matt Hoy and Mick Fanning.

Johns famously helped Newcastle win their maiden premiership in 1997 after sustaining broken ribs and a punctured lung a fortnight earlier. A keen surfer since retiring from league, Johns helped out coaching the Parramatta halves this season while also carrying out his commentary duties with Channel 9. Unlike previous years, Johns will not be an official member of the NSW Blues coaching staff this season because of COVID-19 restrictions. But he will still play a role in the State of Origin series. Johns is close to NSW coach Brad Fittler and Blues assistant Danny Buderus, the three often talking footy.
