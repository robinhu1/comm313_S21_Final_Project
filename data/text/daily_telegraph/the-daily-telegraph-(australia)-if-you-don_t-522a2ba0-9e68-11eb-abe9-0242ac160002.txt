MANU Feildel has told people to "do your own research" when it comes to his former presenting partner Pete Evans's wild claims that coronavirus is a hoax.

The French-born celebrity chef, who has long been a lone defender of Evan's paleo posturising, said he had reached out to his My Kitchen Rules mate, worried at times by his erratic social media posts and -bizarre conspiracy theories.

"As a friend, sometimes I do worry," Feildel said, "but I will pick up the phone and have a chat with him. He seems to be on top of his life, seems to be very happy and he's not worried (by the criticism)." Feildel said Evans had "his own lifestyle and his own thoughts but if he wasn't known by the public, -nobody would care. He's got his lifestyle and ways and I'm not here to criticise them." When it comes to the more dangerous health messages Evans has told his followers in recent months, including selling a $15,000 "Biocharger" that wrongly claimed to cure COVID-19, Feildel said: "It's up to you to do your own research. The same with paleo â€¦ you either follow the guy and believe it, or you don't, so don't follow him. It's as simple as that." Feildel was paired with former MasterChef judges Matt Preston and Gary Mehigan for Channel 7's new food series, Plate Of Origin, which premieres tonight.

He was also signed to star in -another season of Australia's Got Talent, now postponed because of COVID restrictions.

Preston also told today's BINGE Guide he "lost" a deal to appear on UK television, when coronavirus cruelled those plans.

"Lots of friends went from having full diaries for the next six months to having nothing, so I'm grateful for what I've got," he said. BInge: inside today
