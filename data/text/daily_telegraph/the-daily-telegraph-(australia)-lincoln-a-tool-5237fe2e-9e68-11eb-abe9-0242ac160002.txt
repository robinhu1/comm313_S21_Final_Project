CHINA has bizarrely enlisted Abraham Lincoln, the US president best known for freeing the slaves, as its newest foot soldier in its campaign to deflect responsibility for allowing COVID-19 to infect millions of people and send the world's economy into a tailspin.

In a rambling manifesto posted on the website of the Chinese consulate in Auckland entitled "Reality Check of US Allegations Against China on COVID-19", the document accuses "US politicians and media outlet of fabricating preposterous allegations and lies" - and then goes on to attribute a quote to Lincoln (pictured): "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time." Among the claims made in the document is that it is improper to name diseases after their origin - ignoring the fact many including Ross River Fever, Lyme disease and ebola were named after where they were discovered.

The document also claims that Wuhan may not have been the source of the virus at all, and that the Chinese government did everything it could to stop its spread. Never mind the fact that China is stonewalling an investigation into the origin of the virus, threatening Australian farmers over the issue and is further thought to have destroyed samples and suppressed news to make it more difficult to find out what really happened.

Other claims are similarly fantastical, including that whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang was not arrested for attempting to warn of the coming pandemic, but was simply "taken to a police station ... and urged â€¦ to stop spreading unconfirmed information".Oh, one more thing. According to QuoteInvestigator.com, Lincoln "probably did not employ this well-known adage". Another fact China failed to get right.
