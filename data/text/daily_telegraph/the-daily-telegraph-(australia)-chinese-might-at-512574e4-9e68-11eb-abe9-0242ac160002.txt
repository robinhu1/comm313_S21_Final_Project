PERTH's newly minted mus-eum has removed a reference to China from its COVID-19 exhibit after a complaint from the Chinese consul -general.

The Western Australian Museum Boola Bardip multimedia display had described coronavirus as "originating in mainland China".

WA Museum chief executive Alec Coles confirmed there had been a complaint. "The museum was â€¦ contacted by the acting consul-general in Perth about the factual errors, and we were pleased to advise the mistakes were immediately rectified," he said.

It has also changed a reference to the -island of Taiwan being -independent. The exhibit is housed in the Tianqi Lithium Collections Gallery, named after the Chinese mining company which donated $5 million to the museum in 2017.

A WA Museum spokeswoman said the local chief executive of Tianqi Lithium had contacted the Foundation for the WA Museum "for clarification".

"It is important to note that the changes to the exhibit were made in the interests of accuracy, not because of coercion, or in the interests of securing funding," she said.

Members of the mining company's board attended the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party, a university for the country's leaders. In a social media post, the museum said, "one label stated that COVID-19 originated in mainland China. The World Health Organisation is still investigating its origin, therefore this reference has been -updated."
