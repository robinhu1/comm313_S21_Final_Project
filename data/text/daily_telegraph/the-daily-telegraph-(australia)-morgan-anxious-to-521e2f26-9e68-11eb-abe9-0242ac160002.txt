NORTH Queensland captain Michael Morgan is pushing hard for a May 28 return as he continues to recover from the minor shoulder surgery he had during the COVID-19 break.

The club will know more about the 28-year-old's return date next week, but the star playmaker is tracking well before the season resumes.

The skipper joined the rest of the Cowboys in returning to training this week as the North Queensland club prepares for the 18-week "grind".

Under the revamped 2020 NRL format, clubs will play 18 games straight and not the usual 12 to 15 leading into the State of Origin bye rounds.

Cowboys playmaker Scott Drinkwater said there was now more focus on how players treated their recovery sessions.

"It's going to be a grind this season, without having the byes," he said. "It's really important for us to come back in good shape, which all the boys were.

"(Cowboys coach Paul Green) Greeny is really happy with our fitness. Eighteen games straight, it will take a bit of a toll on the body so you have to make sure you're doing all the things right." The 22-year-old livewire made a sizzling start to the 2020 season, kicking off with a player-of-the-tournament display during the NRL Nines.

Drinkwater partnered Morgan in the halves in the first two rounds before the season went into hibernation because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Morgan will be assessed by club physios next week but Drinkwater was confident it would not disrupt their plans.

"I'm not too sure what Morgo's plans are," Drinkwater said. "I'm sure Jake (Clifford) will do a great job if he gets the chance to come in."He played a lot of games last year and is familiar to the halfback role. I'm sure our cohesion will be pretty sweet."
