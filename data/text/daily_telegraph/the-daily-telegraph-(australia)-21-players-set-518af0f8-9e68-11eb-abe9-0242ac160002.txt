Some have changed clubs, others have the promise of a more meaningful role on the horizon while others are looking to bounce back from a bit of a 2020 nightmare.

Check out the 21 players to watch for the 2021 KFC SuperCoach NRL season. Rob Sutherland and Wilson Smith report...

1 Siosifa Talakai - Games 15, PPG: 55, MPG: 59 In a seven-game span from Rounds 13-19 last season, the former Rabbitoh averaged 71MPG and 75PPG with a 90 and two triple-figures scores for Cronulla. He's not a 'base stat monster' however, Talakai is capable of racking up big base stat games for an edge, scoring 70 in base in Round 18 and 59 in Round 14. Adding to his appeal is that Talakai spent a fair portion of his time at centre - and could be eligible for dual position status. He should be priced around the likes of Dale Finucane, Kevin Proctor and Liam Martin, and, while he lacks the assured minutes of these types, he possesses far more attacking upside - not to mention that DPP. A tempting CTW starter.

2 Tino Fa'asuamaleaui- Games: 19, PPG: 57, MPG: 46 He played a mixture of bench, edge, lock and even started at prop for one game at Melbourne. At the Titans he should cement a position as the No.13 and play around 55MPG, though he may start at prop and average close to 50MPG. Regardless, minutes in the middle are SuperCoach money for Tino. In the eight games where he played 45-plus minutes in the middle, Tino averaged 77PPG. That is significantly boosted by tries but he also has a good workrate, averaging 0.96 base points per minute. That's a better base rate output than the likes of Addin Fonua-Blake, Jason Taumalolo and Pat Carrigan managed last year despite averaging fewer minutes.

3 Latrell Mitchell - Games: 14, PPG: 59, MPG: 76 After a slow start at a new club and position, fullback Mitchell proved a rollercoaster ride for owners. He scored as low as nine points and as high as 112 before a two-week suspension for striking Josh Reynolds. On his return Mitchell went on a tear, averaging 75.8, with a low of 43 and a high of 141. Sadly, Mitchell tore his hamstring in Round 16 to end his season. So what to expect in 2021? Well, in just 14 matches Mitchell managed 24 linebreak assists and 15 try assists. If you take out the first two rounds, Mitchell averaged 65.75. That was good enough to rank him ninth at fullback, even though he was a CTW/FLB. But the fullback position is loaded and Mitchell's lack of work compared to his rivals will scare off many. But the reward is there, given he will start at a fair price.

4 Charlie Staines - Games: 2, PPG: 112, MPG: 54 In 107 minutes of NRL action in 2020 'The Forbes Ferrari' scored six tries, including a sensational four on debut. Staines has been earmarked to take the starting wing spot from Josh Mansour, who could leave the Panthers. He won't be a bargain basement price, but nor will he be priced anywhere near his career average. Talent like his should be in your squad for sure.

5&6 Reece Robson - Games: 14, PPG: 56, MPG: 62/Reuben Cotter - Games: 10, PPG: 40, MPG: 50 Should one of these young hookers lock in an 80-minute role at the Cowboys then they would have strong claims to being the mid-range must to start 2021. The Cowboys have three No.9s with Jake Granville there. In five consecutive 80-minute games at dummy half, Robson averaged 77.4PPG and exceeded 50 points in base each match. He played one other 80-minute game in Round 12 for a lazy 88 points (57 in base). Cotter, the starting rake for the Cowboys' final six games, averaged 61PPG, largely in base. Neither want Granville anywhere near the team lists.

7 Tesi Niu - Games: 6, PPG: 29, MPG: 57 (pictured) Niu's best two games came in Rounds 8 and 9 against the Warriors (53 points) and Bulldogs (58 points). He scored a try assist in each game, but the key stat was his involvement, with 17 runs against the Warriors and 18 against the Bulldogs. Should we get lucky and Niu snag DPP CTW/FLB status and he wins the start at fullback then he will be a tempting cheapish CTW buy.

8 Hudson Young - Games: 15, PPG: 54, MPG: 58 Looks the man most likely to take John Bateman's position on the right edge for the Raiders. In the six games he started on an edge last season, Young played the full 80 in all of them and averaged 48 points. That's not super exciting but it is brought down by scores of 28 (Storm) and 32 (Roosters) against two of the toughest teams in the comp. In the other four games, Young's scores read 68 (56 base), 46 (48), 64 (57) and 50 (50) for an average of 57PPG (41.75 base). That's pretty promising, despite a slightly inflated 2021 starting price.

9 Braidon Burns - Games: 8, PPG: 40, MPG: 70 Following a horror injury-hit 2020, Burns should force his way back into the South Sydney starting 13, on the coveted left edge too. With a good workrate, he averages in the low 30s in base, and on top of that he produces excellent tackle bust numbers and above-average offloads too. If he's priced around his 2020 average of 40PPG, Burns will be worth serious mid-range consideration.

10 Jordan Riki - Games: 5, PPG: 35, MPG: 42 In the running to take David Fifita's starting second-row slot. After making his NRL debut from the bench in Round 14, his minutes progressed and culminated in an 80-minute, 50-base-point effort against the Cowboys in Round 20 that included 38 tackles, eight runs, an offload and a couple of tackle busts. We're not talking 'keeper country' scores but, considering his age and price, we are talking ability and opportunity and this is a player who should be in your watchlist.

11 Tom Flegler - Games: 13, PPG: 45, MPG: 44 Flegler started nine games last year (averaging 47PPG and 47.5MPG) and played four more off the bench (averaging 41PPG and 36MPG). Importantly for SuperCoach, Flegler's not just a worker, there's a bit of flash as he averaged eight points a game in offloads/tackle busts. With Joe Ofahengaue's 48MPG, played mostly through the middle, gone, and Matt Lodge on the outer, expect Flegler to jump above him in the pecking order. Not a 'cheapie' by any means, Flegler is certainly capable of adding 10 points to his 2020 PPG and worth keeping a close pre-season eye on.

12 Victor Radley - Games 7, PPG: 50, MPG: 51 (pictured) Another rollercoaster year highlighted by injury. His first five rounds were 25 points (55 minutes), 70 (69), 62 (67) and 105 (66), before the minutes dried up. In Round 5, Radley scored 49 in 48 minutes, Round 6 just 34 in 44. And Round 7, Radley ruptured his ACL and the season was over. So what happens in 2021? When fit, expect him to get plenty of minutes, although not straight away. Watch how his minutes progress and if it looks like he's back to 60-plus then jump on and enjoy the ride.

13 Christian Welch - Games: 16, PPG: 51, MPG: 43 He didn't register solid starter minutes until Round 9, but in 10 games for the dominant Melbourne Storm, he averaged 59.6PPG in 51.4MPG. In the final five games of that stretch the Queensland Origin prop averaged 67.6PPG in 55.2MPG. Welch appears to be another who will be priced 10PPG below what we can reasonably expect him to produce. He won't blow you away but he should keep pace with far pricier options while slowly building in value and sometimes that's all you want.

14 Luke Thompson - Games: 10, PPG: 51, MPG: 54 Forget his mid-season arrival and COVID-hit campaign. Veteran prop Aiden Tolman and his 61MPG are gone and Thompson should pick up the bulk of those minutes in a full-time shift to the front row after pinch-hitting at lock to cover for an injured Adam Elliott. Yet another forward for whom a 10PPG increase on 2020 output is realistic.

15 Sam Walker - Yet to play NRL Expected to be the Roosters' long-term halfback after the club released Kyle Flanagan. No certainty to start 2021 with Lachie Lam offering a bigger-bodied alternative, but should be in your team if there's even a whisper that he may start. It would be nice if we can jag dual halfback, five-eighth eligibility as rookie-priced DPP halves add great flexibility to your halves.

16 Tom Trbojevic - Games: 7, PPG: 67, MPG: 73 Just 19 games in two years for an all-important fullback spot is risky, but Tommy Turbo is capable of punching out triple-figure boomers with ease and possessing a floor of around 70 points. Trbojevic is cheap at a 67PPG average as 2017-19 he averaged near enough 10PPG better and the faster game under the six-again rule application is custom-built for work-hungry fullbacks who hang around the ruck like a kelpie looking for work.

17 Tariq Sims - games: 9, PPG: 46, MPG: 68 Injuries limited him to just nine games and his MPG dropped 10 minutes on the 78MPG he averaged in 2019. Tyson Frizell's departure from St George Illawarra means Sims will be needed to play big minutes. In 2020 he played the full 80 minutes three times and averaged a tick under 60PPG. The year before, 15 of his 19 games were the full 80 minutes. An edge who can play some middle, if Sims can stay healthy he's every chance to average 10+ PPG more than he managed in 2020, making him a stepping stone to someone better.

18 Christian Tuipulotu - Games: 1, PPG: 67, MPG: 80 In just one game Tuipulotu scored 67 points with 23 runs, four tackle busts, a linebreak and a try - all against the Melbourne Storm. That's the work-rate we want from a winger and why Manly snapped him up from the Roosters. Tuipulotu also played one game in the NSW Cup in 2020 and had 22 runs for 157m - workrate. I expect him to put serious pressure on incumbent winger Jorge Taufua and, when he gets selected, he comes straight into our SuperCoach squad.

19/20 Jacob Liddle - Games: 6, PPG: 31, MPG: 30/Jake Simpkin - Yet to play NRL Liddle would appear to have the early running for the Tigers' hooking job but, with an injury history, Simpkin will likely get a run sooner rather than later.

In the five of his 44 games where Liddle played 50+ minutes, he averaged 62PPG (61MPG). Simpkin impressed through the junior ranks playing Queensland under-18 Origin in 2019 (41 tackles, 86 running metres and a try) before COVID-19 restricted him to just one game of NSW Cup in 2020 (45 minutes with 26 tackles made, 32 running metres and a try assist). Whichever player wins Round 1 selection will be worth consideration as a cheapie hooker option.

21 Valentine Holmes - Games: 12, PPG: 58, MPG: 73 With a proper off-season under his belt, 2021 could produce the best of Holmes, if he keeps the fullback role from Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow. Holmes had a season average of 58 points (64.5 if you take out injury affected games). With four tries, nine try assists, seven linebreaks, 10 linebreak assists, three SuperCoach scores above 90 and goalkicking, the value is there as a mid-range fullback, given the Queensland Origin winger ended 2020 with a $88,200 price drop.
