THE Broncos have baulked at a proposal to relocate to Sydney and are investigating a self-isolation camp in the NSW Northern Rivers should the club be forced to abandon Queensland.

The Daily Telegraph can reveal the Broncos and coach Anthony Seibold (pictured) have a contingency plan to hold an Origin-style camp in far-north NSW if the Queensland government refuses to relax border controls in time for the NRL's planned relaunch on May 28.

The development comes as ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys vowed to do everything possible to avoid pulling Broncos, Cowboys and Titans players out of the Sunshine State.

The NRL is leaving no stone unturned to resume the premiership next month and that extends to the three Queensland teams - the Broncos, Cowboys and Titans - shifting to Sydney if the league cannot overcome border restrictions related to the COVID-19 saga.

The Titans have indicated they are prepared to relocate 842km to Sydney, but the Broncos are exploring other options to remain as close to the Queensland border as possible. Queensland's glamour club is considering setting up base in the NSW Northern Rivers if they are required to recommence training as planned on Monday, May 4.

Proposed location sites include Tweed Heads or Kingscliff, which has previously hosted the NSW Origin team, and more recently the Warriors when the coronavirus pandemic forced their relocation for last month's clash against Canberra.The Broncos hope a self-isolation training camp just south of the Tweed would allow a less disruptive return to Red Hill if the Queensland government eventually relaxes border rules for NRL travel in late May. The Broncos' preference is to get the government green light to remain on Queensland soil.
