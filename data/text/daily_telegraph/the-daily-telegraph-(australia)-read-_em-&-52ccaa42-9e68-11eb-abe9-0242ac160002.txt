AUSSIE wheat farmers have become the latest victims of China's vendetta against our nation, with the communist state slashing its Australian wheat imports to an almost 10-year low.

It comes as Beijing ramps up its attack on Australian farm commodities and threatens to disrupt international trade worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

China imported 880 tonnes of Australian wheat in November - the lowest amount since 2011 - according to customs data, as tensions between Beijing and Canberra show no signs of abating.

Australia exports about $4.6 billion worth of wheat a year globally, with China accounting for about 10 per cent of it.

Beijing's tightening on Australian wheat comes amid a blockbuster crop for Australian farmers, with production forecast to more than double this season to about 31 million tonnes, according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE).

China's communist regime has already slapped punitive tariffs or banned a range of Australian products from barley, timber and beef, to wine and seafood after Scott Morrison sought an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19. FULL REPORT IN BUSINESS P60-61
