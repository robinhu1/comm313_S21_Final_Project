AUSTRALIA has asked powerful world leaders, including China, to consider an independent committee headed by a top UK health expert to lead an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.

The federal Government is using every available inter-national channel, including private talks with the Chinese Government and formally writing to the G20, to seek support for an independent review into the COVID-19 pandemic response.

In a letter to G20 leaders this week Prime Minister Scott Morrison outlined two possible mechanisms for an independent review, believing some existing groups were well placed to make recommendations to the World Health Organisation.

One option was to have the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Emergencies Program lead the inquiry. It is understood Australia sees the committee, led by UK public health expert Dr Felicity Harvey, as almost purpose built for the review.

The second option put forward by Mr Morrison to G20 leaders was to use WHO's International Health Regulations which is an agreement between all WHO member nations to build their capacity to detect, assess and report public health events.

Australia is hoping to build a coalition of the willing to support an inquiry, which Mr Morrison has emphasised is about learning the lessons of the outbreak, rather than targeting any one country.It is understood the government hopes its upfront -approach will be successful.
