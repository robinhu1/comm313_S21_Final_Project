SOMEONE forgot to tell Channel 9 that last night's premiership relaunch match was the most-anticipated game of football in any code for years.

Footy-starved viewers switching on the Eels-Broncos match would no doubt have expected to hear the beautiful dulcet tones of Ray "Rabs" Warren, a household name and the voice of rugby league.

Not so. The great man watched from home.

Instead, Channel 9 used -little-known lower-grade caller Peter Psaltis to commentate out of Suncorp Stadium, a shock choice considering the magnitude of the game.

Rabs has a well-known dislike for aeroplanes plus the Queensland border is still closed, courtesy of COVID-19 and a stubborn premier.

Still, surely the great man could have called off the big screens from the station's Sydney studios.

We are talking about the first media man to be inducted into the NRL's Hall of Fame since our late and great mate Peter "Chippy" Frilingos.

Even Rabs' legendary sidekick, the great Phil "Gus" Gould, was not at Suncorp. Instead, he was on an expert panel in Sydney.

A spokesman for Channel 9 said Warren is working tonight instead on the Rabbitohs-Roosters blockbuster. However, Fox Sports produced the big guns last night when ace caller Andrew Voss was alongside Greg "Brandy" Alexander and Maroons Origin coach Kevvy Walters. Corey Parker was also on the sideline.
