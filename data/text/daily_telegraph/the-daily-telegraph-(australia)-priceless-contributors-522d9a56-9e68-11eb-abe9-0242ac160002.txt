THEY are the 81 unsung heroes who have made the untold sacrifice to keep the NRL season alive.

On JobKeeper-level wages, stuck in the bubble and without the chance to get a second job or play in a second-tier competition, it's hard to find many in rugby league who have done it as tough in 2020 as the NRL's development players.

The entire competition took a 48 per cent pay cut for the last five months due to the COVID-19 -pandemic. But that's very different for somebody on an NRL development wage compared to a Test and Origin star.

While young guns like Cody Ramsey, Jai Field and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow have cashed in on their chance, dozens of rookies are still fighting for their futures amid uncertainty around next season's salary cap and roster sizes.

The NRL and RLPA are currently locked in negotiations regarding squad sizes for 2021, but both sides are committed to stopping fringe players slipping through the cracks.

"Squad sizes were always a critical part of these ongoing negotiations as it was important there was certainty provided for players and clubs," said RLPA CEO Clint Newton.

"We now have alignment across the industry in this particular area, with everyone working towards squads of 30 and between two and four development contracts.

"The game has been able to preserve as many contracts as possible in challenging circumstances, which is an outstanding result for our members over the next two years." Former Broncos winger Denan Kemp knows exactly what it's like to have his career caught on the ragged edge. Even when the 33-year old was a consistent first grader for Brisbane he occasionally had to pull beers on the side to make ends meet.

So when news of the pay cut came through, Kemp knew exactly who would be hit hardest.

"My immediate worry wasn't for someone like Cameron Smith or Daly Cherry-Evans it was for the boys on the edge," Kemp said.

"They're basically living two lives, they're trying to progress in their normal life and make ends meet but they can't fully commit to that because they're trying to make their rugby league dreams come alive.

"They can't even go out and get another job. It's kind of the untold sacrifice." To help out, Kemp has partnered with the RLPA to donate two weeks worth of profits from his Bloke in a Bar social media empire to the -players who are most vulnerable.

"My whole career I was basically a second-tier player pay-wise even though I was an NRL player," said Kemp. "Even when I was in the NRL at some stages I had a second job, I was pouring beers to make ends meet. I thought I was lucky enough to have what I have, and that's all due to the footy community and the players, so why not use that platform to give back?" Injuries have forced several clubs to draw deep on their development lists with players like Tabuai-Fidow, Field and Ramsey all seeing plenty of NRL action. Others, like Cronulla's Siosifa Talakai, have parlayed those appearances into upgraded contracts. But even the players who never make the grade are an invaluable part of a teams wider squad and help young players, or late bloomers, make the transition to the top grade.

"Training sessions can't happen without the reserve graders," Kemp said. "We'd come in, do all the training with them, and when the A team does their run through you have to be there for that. But then you'd drive out to your Queensland Cup side and train with them as well.

"You almost work more as a fringe first grader than if you're a first grader. It's all part of the grind, and plenty of people have got it worse, but it can be a precarious situation."

SALUTE TO FRINGE PLAYERS CODY RAMSEY Contract status: Off contract at end of 2021 His emergence has been a rare bright spot in a horrendous year for St George Illawarra but the 20- year-old was nearly lost to the game. After juggling work as a mechanical plumber and commuting to Wollongong for training, Ramsey gave himself a last shot at landing a contract. "I don't think I would have kept playing if I wasn't on the rookie deal cause I did make it hard on myself," he said. He earned a development deal but a shoulder injury almost ended his season. He finally made his NRL debut three weeks ago.

HAMISO TABUAI-FIDOW Contract status: Off contract at end of 2022 Shot to prominence after a star showing in the Nines.

"We probably thought he lacked the physical maturity to play NRL this year, especially considering he hadn't had a grounding in the Intrust Super Cup," Cowboys interim coach Josh Hannay said.

Instead, after debuting in Round 5 against the Warriors, he played 14 matches and scored six tries.

SIOSIFA TALAKAI Contract status:Re-signed until the end of 2021 Two years after flipping bins to make ends meet, the Sharks back-rower now has his sights set on playing Test football.

"I am a bit proud, but still ambitious. I'm always hungry, never satisfied. There's still a fair few things I want to get done before I say I'm really proud," said Talakai.

JAI FIELD Contract status: Off contract at the end of 2020 Field was always supposed to wear blue and gold this year - but for Leeds. "I had a deal agreed, we were waiting for Rhyse Martin to go over to a Papua New Guinea passport to open up a roster spot," he said. "It started to look like it wasn't going to happen, so I ended up at Parra on a train and trial. I went OK in the trials."

JORDAN RIKI Contract status: Off contract at the end of 2021 this raw-boned Kiwi could just be the man to replace the departing David Fifita. Capable of playing on the edge or in the middle, the 20-year old is an exciting prospect with excellent footwork, power and mobility.

"He's definitely got a lot of talent," said Broncos skipper Alex Glenn. "He's got a lot of potential."
