A TRAIL of venues across Sydney and Newcastle have been placed on high alert after they were visited by young people infected with COVID-19.

Nine venues across Sydney and seven in Newcastle were yesterday notified that confirmed cases of coronavirus had attended their premises.

It comes as an inner-city bar and Maitland cafe each copped a $5000 fine for flouting social distancing rules.

NSW recorded 12 new cases of COVID-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm on Wednesday night. Ten were locally acquired and linked to clusters while two are under investigation.

Venues that have been put on alert after visits from infected people include the Jambo Jambo African restaurant, Eveleigh Hotel in Redfern, Warren View Hotel in Enmore, Mary's in Macquarie Place, Cubby's Kitchen, Burrow Bar, Woolworths Marrickville Metro, Penrith Plaza, Master Hot Pot in Canley Vale and BBQ City Buffet in Bankstown.

An infected man in Newcastle also visited the Bennett Hotel (pictured), Bar 88 and Sydney Junction Hotel between July 31 and August 2.

Patrons who visited Greenroof Bar and Restaurant, Sushi Revolution Hamilton, Queens Wharf Hotel or McDonald Jones Stadium between July 31 and August 2 have also been told to stay alert for symptoms.

Darlo Bar in Sydney was fined over an incident on August 1 where patrons were seated less than 1.5m apart.

And the Soul Origin cafe in Maitland was also fined after inspectors found no COVID signage as well as tables and chairs too close together.

It comes as government data has revealed young people are increasingly careful in following guidelines due to increasing concern for family members. Half of those aged 18 to 34 years are now complying, up from 40 per cent.
