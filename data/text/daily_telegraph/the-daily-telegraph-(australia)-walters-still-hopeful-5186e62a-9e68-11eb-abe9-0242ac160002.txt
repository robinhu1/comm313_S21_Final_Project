QUEENSLAND coach Kevin Walters has backed plans for Suncorp Stadium to retain one State of Origin match this season as a tribute to Maroons Immortal Arthur Beetson.

The "Project Artie" campaign is in full swing, with ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys revealing his desire to reward Queensland fans with a Suncorp game to celebrate Origin's 40-year anniversary.

The Queensland Rugby League has held talks with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to gauge the possibility of border restrictions being eased in the coming months to pave the way for an Origin celebration on Beetson's home turf.

The coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc with Origin's June-July scheduling and the Maroons were bracing for the prospect of playing all three interstate games against NSW in Sydney this season.

But the NRL's Project Apollo team is keen not to rob Queensland of an Origin game and Walters, who was 12 when he watched Beetson's famous Maroons debut in 1980, is relishing a Suncorp celebration.

"It's the 40th anniversary of Origin and what the great Artie Beetson did for Queensland will never be forgotten," Walters said.

"If we have to play three Origin games in NSW we would do that, but it would be wonderful to have one game in Queensland for everything Artie Beetson achieved." Game three at Suncorp this year was slated for July 8 - the night of Origin's debut at Lang Park in 1980 - but the ARLC is now considering an October series in the hope the COVID-19 crisis will ease to allow crowds to attend.

QRL chairman Bruce Hatcher sees merit in an Origin series after this year's NRL grand final."If it weren't possible to play it in the first six to eight weeks, then I'd look to play it in October or November and I'd love to play at least one game in Queensland," Hatcher said.
