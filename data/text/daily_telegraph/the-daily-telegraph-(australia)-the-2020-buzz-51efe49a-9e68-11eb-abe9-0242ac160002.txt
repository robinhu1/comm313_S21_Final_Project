AND THE WINNERS ARE â€¦ PHIL 'BUZZ' ROTHFIELD HANDS OUT HIS 2020 AWARDS SPORTSMAN OF THE YEAR NRL Commissioner Peter V'landys leads the world of sport in the way he guides rugby league through the COVID-19 pandemic. His performance is the equal of scoring three tries and kicking six goals in a grand final as he saves the code from financial ruin.

SPORTSWOMEN OF THE YEAR Australia's incredible women's cricket team defeats India by 85 runs to win the T20 World Cup in front of 86,174 fans at the MCG. And then COVID-19 turns the sporting world on its head.

SADDEST DAY Dean Jones' death in India left us all in shock. It is a sad moment for all fans who grew to love cricket because of Deano.

TOUGHEST CALL Ray "Rabbits" Warren is 77 and has been talking about hanging up the microphone at Channel 9. Rabs has provided the soundtrack for so many great rugby league moments and memories. A true legend.

BEST CELEBRATION Katy Perry performs after the T20 final, with the Aussie women dancing on stage with her.

DONALD TRUMP AWARD FOR NOT KNOWING WHEN TO QUIT Storm captain and Immortal-in-waiting Cameron Smith. I said I'd never tell a champion when to quit, but Harry Grant did it for me in Origin III. The Storm could not keep Smith for one year only to lose Harry for a decade.

FOOD FIGHT South Sydney coach Wayne Bennett breaks NRL protocols when he has lunch at Grappa Restaurant with his partner. Having to miss two games to self-quarantine is his just desserts...

SEX, DRUGS AND ROCK AND TROLL Anthony Seibold deserves criticism for the way his Broncos played, but the savage social media attacks on his family and Anthony shines a light on the ugliest side of sport and society.

FINE LINE BETWEEN KEVIN AND HELL Kevvie Walters' appointment as coach should bring the passion back to Brisbane, so NSW fans should enjoy the Broncos' fall because it may not last long.

DAZE OF OUR LIVES Roosters and NSW skipper Boyd Cordner creates a headache for his club and the game with repeated concussions. He's such a courageous player and needs to be protected from himself.

WORST TEAM SELECTION Benny Elias slams your columnist for pointing out Freddy Fittler and Greg Alexander stuffed up the Blues bench for the deciding Origin game by not picking Ryan Papenhuyzen. Freddy later admits in a review he picked the wrong team. Thank you Benjamin!

TIK-TOK-KABOOM Nathan Cleary's dance video during the COVID break probably costs him the Dally M Medal with his two-game ban. It is a misstep that leaves NRL headquarters ready to twist and shout.

SMOKING GUN AWARD Latrell Mitchell and Josh Addo-Carr foolishly breaking social distancing rules to blow off steam by firing rifles at Mitchell's farm - and filming it. Ah, footy players.

LOWEST ACT New South Sydney Rabbitohs forward Jai Arrow attacking an almost unconscious James Tedesco in Origin III at Suncorp Stadium. What a disgraceful thing to do.

LITTLE MASTER AWARD Clive Churchill was an undersized fullback who became an Immortal. How fitting is it that Melbourne's No.1 Ryan Papenhuyzen wins the award named in Clive's honour for his grand final effort.

THE HAND OF GOD World sport loses a giant with the death of soccer icon Diego Maradona, aged 60. He lived a life of excess off the pitch, but was a genius on it. How good was he? He made his debut for Argentina at 16! Enough said.

MOMENT OF THE YEAR Canberra prop Josh Papalii's 60m chase and ankle tap on Titans halfback Jamal Fogarty was not only the best play of 2020, but one of the greatest front-row efforts this old journo has seen.

MARY, MARY QUITE CONTRARY Paul McGregor is one of the true gentlemen of rugby league and it was tough to see him sacked as St George Illawarra coach. It was a decision the big Red V had to make, but in football some people don't get what they deserve.

DOPE OF THE YEAR I Cronulla young gun Bronson Xerri testing positive to performance-enhancing drugs. This kid could have been anything.

DOPE OF THE YEAR II It's even harder to forgive Parramatta veteran Michael Jennings, who missed the Eels' sudden-death semi against Souths when told on the day of the game he had returned a positive drugs test. There are no excuses.

BEST ENDURANCE My old mate Phil Gould almost lasted a full season on Twitter without shutting his account - but fell at the last hurdle, pulling the plug in November. But he was back online in time for Christmas.

HOLDING A GRUDGE AWARD Souths' record-breaking 60-8 demolition of arch-enemy the Roosters. Can't wait until they meet again in 2021.

SEX AND OUT Bulldogs pair Jayden Okunbor and Corey Harawira-Naera are sacked after a sex scandal at Port Macquarie. Okunbor is eventually reinstated by the Dogs and Harawira-Naera is picked up by Canberra.

FAST FEUDS I Revelations emerged on the eve of the finals that Canberra's Ricky Stuart and the Roosters' Trent Robinson are playing "no-speakies". It's a fun game.

FAST FEUDS II There remains no love lost between former Broncos coach and Souths mentor Wayne Bennett and former Souths coach and deposed Broncos mentor Anthony Seibold.

BREAKING BUD It's time to ask if Buddy Franklin's nine-year, $10 million contract has been worth it. No premierships, he's hardly played in two seasons (didn't play at all in 2020) and the Swans are mired in mediocrity.

TEAM OF THE YEAR Penrith's bittersweet 17-game winning streak is one of the big stories of the sporting season, but it ends on grand final day. Despite that heartbreak, I can't go past them as the year's top sporting team in any code.

BOMBSHELL OF THE YEAR Allegations of domestic violence and drug use surrounding South Sydney icon Sam Burgess will have major ramifications for the code and Rabbits if proven, but he deserves his day in court.

RED FLAG AWARD Aussie touch judge Angus Gardner makes the blunder of the Year when he misses All Blacks winger Reiko Ioane stepping on the touchline in the lead-up to the All Blacks' opening try in the 16-16 draw at Eden Park. Do I hear "bunker", anyone?

SIMPLY THE BREAST AWARD Sydney FC's Rhyan Grant (below) is the hero of the Sky Blues' grand final win against Melbourne City, scoring with his "nipple", as Fox's Andy Harper so succinctly put, in the 10th minute of extra time.

SOFT SERVE Is it any wonder rugby is struggling? Watching Wallabies rookie Lachie Swinton and All Blacks prop Ofa Tu'ungafasi get sent off for tackles that would have barely knocked the dandruff of their opponents should is ridiculous. It is a Bledisloe Test, not the local under-8s. At least the Wallabies win, 24-22.

2 GUYS, A GIRL & A PIZZA PLACE Some blokes never learn. Manly's Dylan Walker getting himself in trouble seems to be a recurring theme of off-seasons. This time he's arrested for allegedly assaulting two men outside a pizza place and jumping into the car of a woman he doesn't know.

BUY OF THE YEAR Api Koroisau's return to Penrith from Manly couldn't have gone any better. The little hooker makes all the difference to Ivan Cleary's team.

THE MEATLOAF AWARD Forget two out of three, jockey Kerrin McEvoy's effort to win this third TAB Everest crown in just four runnings of the great sprint is a mighty effort. Classique Legend's win followed McEvoy's double on Redzel in 2017 and 2018.

THE BETTER HALF Benji Marshall is still without a club after being shown the door by the Wests Tigers despite having a better season than Luke Brooks and Josh Reynolds.

POOR DIDDUMS AWARD High-paid Tigers pair Josh Reynolds and Russell Packer leave Brookvale at halftime and miss their team's stunning comeback win against Manly. Their reason - they were cold.

LAWN SERVICE Tigers prop Josh Aloaia wants to break his contract to join Manly. Tigers chairman Lee Hagipantelis says Aloia isn't leaving and can mow the grounds at Leichhardt and Campbelltown. Someone's getting their grass cut here.

SPLITTING HAIRS AWARD Tevita Pangai Jnr's hardly been a team player at the Broncos, but rather than sack the big forward for a wilful breach of bio-security rules, Brisbane fine him $30,000 and stand him down for the season. If you want a glimpse of the Broncos' issues, it's right there.

THE GLITTER STRIP 20-year-old David Fifita's $3.5 million defection to the Gold Titans brings extra spotlight and pressure on one of the best young talents in the game. It's finals or bust now on the Gold Coast.

WHOLE NEW BRAWL GAME Rugby league turns into a boxing match at the Tribal League competition. Walgett Aboriginal Connection's Tyronne Roberts-Davis and Newcastle Hawks' Randall Briggs stand toe-to-toe throwing haymakers. That's why the punching ban is needed.

DOG FINDS HIS WAY HOME I am delighted Kieran Foran will get to finish his career at Manly alongside Daly Cherry-Evans. They were a great pairing and Foran showed enough at the Dogs to suggest he'll be an asset.

OLD SCHOOL Youngsters Payne Haas (NSW) and Tino Fa'asuamaleaui (Queensland) bring their schoolboy rivalry to the Origin stage with an old-fashioned punch-up.

MERRY EX-MAS The Roosters give young gun half Kyle Flanagan an early "Christmas bonus" by flicking him to the Bulldogs. The Tricolours' ruthless response to a straight-sets finals exit? Sack the kid.

CRUEL TWIST Roosters' hopes of a hat-trick of titles effectively ends as Victor Radley and Sam Verrills tear their ACLs within minutes of each other versus the Dragons.

ONE-FINGER SALUTE Cam Smith breaks the try-scoring tally (46) of his coach Craig Bellamy against the Tigers. Bellamy's response is to give his skipper the bird.

TWILIGHT ZONE I never thought we'd see it again, but Twilight Payment leads from go-to-whoa, giving owner Lloyd Williams his seventh Cup triumph. It's a brilliant run.

ALL BETS ARE OFF Tabcorp issues apology after a glitch prevents punters from wagering on the Melbourne Cup carnival final day. Oops.

PHANTOM PUNCH Mark Hunt going after Paul Gallen at the weigh-in for their heavyweight fight. Stunt anyone? Wouldn't have knocked your old columnist over.

BEST MARKETING The Sonny Bill Williams comeback at the Roosters. Only a shadow of the superstar player he once was but added enormous interest in his five-game stint.

GREATEST OFF-FIELD PERFORMANCE The Warriors' approach to COVID-19 and decision to stay in Australia is a credit to coaches Stephen Kearney (axed) and Todd Payten, captain Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and the rest of the club. It should never be forgotten

CLINT EASTWOOD: COMEDIAN Has someone been writing Grand Torino Wayne Bennett some new one-liners - "maybe should we drug test journalists" â€¦ "I'm too old for schoolies". We even saw him smiling in the coaches' box. Know your role, Wayne.

SUCKER PUNCH The people who bought the Mike Tyson-Roy Jones Jr golden oldies fight. Two 50-plus seniors huffing and puffing for a contrived draw now joins UFC on this column's banned list.

X-RATED AWARD Manly's Addin Fonua-Blake's foul-mouthed rant at referee Grant Atkins after the loss to Newcastle is not on. The two-match ban is too light.

INDIVIDUAL TRY OF THE YEAR Brisbane centre Kotoni Staggs pushes off Dragons opposite Euan Aitken and burns fullback Matt Dufty in an explosive 60-metre run.

TEAM TRY OF THE YEAR Warriors half Chanel Harris-Tavita handles three times in a movement against Parramatta that goes to both touchlines and features two kicks.

HIT OF THE YEAR I Bulldogs winger Dallin Watene-Zelezniak comes and hits Sharks playmaker Matt Moylan with a classic bellringer.

HIT OF THE YEAR II Eels winger Maika Sivo proves you can be just as brutal with the ball when he uses Roosters superstar fullback James Tedesco as a speed bump to score.

GOOD-TIME CHARLIE Panthers winger Charlie Staines (left) scores four tries on debut, becoming only the sixth player in history to achieve the feat. A few days later he is stood down for breaking COVID-19 restrictions by hosting a party at home.

AN INCONVENIENT TOOTH Gold Coast skipper Kevin Proctor is found guilty of biting Sharks star and Kiwis teammate Shaun Johnson. Suspended for four games.

NO RINGS ATTACHED For proof of what a strange year it has been, having the Olympic Games suspended due to COVID underlines it in red felt pen. Previously, only World Wars have paused the Olympics.

BOOK OF FEUDS: CHAPTER 7986 The Roosters sneak under Souths' guard to sign teen freak Joseph Suaalii for 2022. Souths initially refuse to release him to their arch-rivals but eventually back off. No point keeping a kid who doesn't want to be there.

NO KID GLOVES Tim Tszyu showed he is much more than Kostya's boy when dissecting former world champion Jeff Horn. There has to be a world title fight in his near future.

SOUR GRAPES Josh Addo-Carr should have been awarded a penalty try in the dying moments of Origin III when taken out by Maroons fullback Corey Allan. There, I said it.

MUNSTER'S BALL I can't believe I'm writing this, but Cameron Munster's performance in Origin III rivals anything I have seen from a Queensland No.6 - and that includes King Wally and Johnathan Thurston.

WE'RE ALL WILD ABOUT HARRY If we're raving about Munster, we should be equally effusive about hooker Harry Grant. His debut rivals any Queensland performance since â€¦ well, Munster in 2017.

MAN OF THE CENTURY What about Steve Smith? A 61-ball ton and a 62-ball hundred to start the international cricket summer.

WORST TIPSTER Yes, I admit. I told Ben Ikin on Fox that NSW would win the Origin series 3-0. You'd think an old bloke like me would know better than to write off those Cane Toads - until next year, of course.

JAW-DROPPING MOMENT Paul Gallen took bombs from former UFC warrior Mark Hunt to stay undefeated in the boxing ring in a thrilling night at Bankwest Stadium. What a tough fight.

HEARTFELT SALUTE 2020 has been a year like no other, especially for all the dedicated sportsmen and women who couldn't get into the arenas or on the fields. We hope Australians are back out there doing us proud in front of big crowds again in 2021.

DEAL OR NO DEAL Panthers' rising superstar Stephen Crichton backflips on a commitment to sign a long-term deal with the club to explore his options elsewhere. Watch the chequebooks come out now.

FEELING DUSTY I would love to see Dustin Martin play rugby league. What an athlete. His grand final performance to win a third Norm Smith Medal was one of the great sporting performances.
