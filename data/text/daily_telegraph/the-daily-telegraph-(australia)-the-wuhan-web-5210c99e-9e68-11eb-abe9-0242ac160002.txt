CHINA may have fudged its COVID-19 death figures by tens of thousands, according to figures which tracked crematory operations in Wuhan this year.

A study published on the preprint server medRxiv claims the official Chinese statistics on COVID-19 cases and the country's mortality rate were wildly out, with 36,000 deaths recorded by March instead of the official 2524 - with half a million people infected with the virus. The study looked at investigative media reports of crematory operations in Wuhan - the origin and -epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.
