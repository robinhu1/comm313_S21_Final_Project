COWBOYS fullback Valentine Holmes used the NRL season suspension to fast-track his return to rugby league.

Holmes will be back in North Queensland's No. 1 jersey when the Cowboys reboot their 2020 campaign against the Gold Coast Titans in Townsville next Friday night.

The two-month COVID-19 shutdown was a speed bump for Holmes, who was only two games into his Cowboys career following a one-year sojourn in the NFL.

But the Queensland Origin flyer used the break to further hone his league skills after missing a year of footy while he tried to crack into the NFL with the New York Jets.

Holmes, 24, practised catching bombs by himself and did early morning fitness sessions in Townsville parks to ensure he was ready when the NRL season rebooted. He said: "I couldn't have anyone putting bombs up for me so I'd do it myself and chase them."
