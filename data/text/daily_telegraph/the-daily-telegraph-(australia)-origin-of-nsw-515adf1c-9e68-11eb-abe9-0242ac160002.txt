MORE than half of NSW's coronavirus cases caught the infection while abroad, and now figures from the health department reveal where they had come from.

According to NSW Health data, Australians travelling home from Pakistan, the US, UK, India, and cruise ship passengers, are responsible for 58 per cent of coronavirus infections in quarantine.

The vast majority of those returning from overseas are Australian residents who live and work abroad.

Since March 29, there have been 786 confirmed COVID-19 cases among returned travellers, the vast majority of whom are Australian nationals.

The figures suggest cruise passengers and crew accounted for 16 per cent - 125 people. These cases involved international cruise ships, not ships that have docked in Australia. About 14 per cent were Australians returning from Pakistan (109 people), 11 per cent came from the US (87 people), 8.8 per cent from Britain (69 people) and 8.5 per cent from India (67 people). The figures come after NSW recorded six consecutive days of zero community transmission
