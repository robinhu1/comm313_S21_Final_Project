THE NRL and the RLPA are about $25 million apart when it comes to cost-cutting measures for the next three years.

Discussions between the two parties are ongoing and include a potential roster cull. The salary cap could drop by about 5 per cent but cost savings are being explored in other areas including injury hardship, marketing and representative payments. While the NRL and the RLPA have agreed to a reduced cap for this year, there could be further cuts in 2020 including how much players will be paid to play Origin.

Clubs are also expecting roster squads to be cut to 28 next year. There have been discussions around keeping up to four development players or the potential for reintroducing a second-tier salary cap.

The NRL and the RLPA are hopeful of having the situation cleared up next week. Clubs were also told they need to be flexible as the COVID-19 situation worsens in Victoria and Queensland. The prospect of moving the four Queensland-based teams to NSW was raised.

Club bosses also told interim NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo to scuttle any plans for a hybrid match between the Kangaroos and the All Black at season's end.

Several club bosses raised their concerns during the phone hook-up, clearly getting their point across that there is no appetite for the match in club-land. One club boss said: "Rugby need it more than us, so why would we even contemplate it?"
