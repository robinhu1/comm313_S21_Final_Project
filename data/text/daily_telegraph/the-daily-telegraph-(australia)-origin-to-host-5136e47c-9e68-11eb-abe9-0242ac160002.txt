WEDNESDAY night's Origin Game 3 in Brisbane is about to set a world record for the biggest outdoor sporting event since the COVID-19 pandemic struck, as the 52,000 seat Suncorp Stadium edges closer to a sellout.

The Queensland Government announced last week that the blockbuster decider is set to be played in front of a -capacity crowd - almost all of them Queenslanders given the strict border regulations.

Since the announcement that the stadium could have a full capacity, the NRL has released 16,000 seats, of which only about 4000 remain.

Even with 48,000 sold, the game will be the largest sporting event in the world since the global pandemic took over, with Game Two of the Bledisloe Cup in New Zealand understood to have been the previous biggest crowd at 46,049. In Australia, the current record stands at 37,303 for the NRL grand final at ANZ Stadium. The expected sellout follows a year where huge sporting events such as the Melbourne Cup, English Premier League, the NBA and the NFL have been played behind closed doors, sometimes in newly-built stadiums.
