AUSTRALIA'S wine war with China may be escalated to the World Trade Organisation after Beijing announced it would continue massive tariffs on some winemakers from Down Under.

On Friday, China's Ministry of Commerce confirmed it would impose a tariff of 200 per cent as "anti-dumping measures on some Australian wine imports from March 28 for (another) five years".

China has previously acc-used Australian wine producers of "dumping", or lowering prices below the cost of manufacturing in a bid to -increase market share in its gigantic economy.

Beijing has accused the federal government of subsidising Australian wines in order for them to be exported and sold cheaply in China.

This is seen as an excuse to punish Australia for its temerity to question the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Federal Trade Minister Dan Tehan has previously rejected suggestions Australia's wine industry was subsidised.

Department of Foreign -Affairs and Trade officials told Senate Estimates the value of Australian trade with China for almost all industries had plummeted by 40 per cent. Wine exports have sunk to less than $1 million.
