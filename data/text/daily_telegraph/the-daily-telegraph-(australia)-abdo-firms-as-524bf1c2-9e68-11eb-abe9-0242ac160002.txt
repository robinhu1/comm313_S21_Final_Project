INTERIM NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo is expected to begin the painful process of streamlining head office with the backing of the ARL Commission as it prepares to confirm next week that he has the job on a permanent basis.

Abdo will front the commission next Thursday and make his pitch to remove the -'interim' from his title. It seems a mere formality that he will emerge from that meeting with their seal of approval given the way he has kept the game afloat during one of the most challenging times in rugby league's history.

Abdo has been acting in an interim capacity since late-April and, along with commission chair Peter V'landys, he has miraculously kept the NRL chugging along, negotiating the COVID-19 crisis, restless club bosses, biosecurity breaches and bouts with broadcasters.

The commission is expected to discuss the salary cap, football department cap and State of Origin. Abdo has also been working on a restructure of League Central designed to strip some of the fat from the code's running costs. It is understood he will outline his vision for the future to the commission and his coronation will be the first step in a reshaping of head office, as promised cuts begin to take effect in coming months.
