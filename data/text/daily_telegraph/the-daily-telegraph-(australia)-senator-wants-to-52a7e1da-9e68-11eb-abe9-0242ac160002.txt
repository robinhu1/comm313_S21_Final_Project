TIES between Australian researchers and the Chinese military need to be stopped in the interest of national security, says National Party Senator Matt Canavan.

He said recent reports within Australian and from around the world had raised serious concerns about co-operation with Chinese government-connected researchers An exclusive report in The Daily Telegraph recently outlined how China's People's Liberation Army has been involved in scientific research, co-funded by the Australian government, into the origins of the coronavirus which has been published in esteemed medical journals.

In an explosive revelation, a study co-funded by the Australian Research Council and the Chinese government, and trumpeted by The University of Sydney as helping to solve the puzzle of how COVID-19 transferred from animals to humans, relied on a key laboratory in an institute in the People's Liberation Army's Academy of Military Medical Sciences to conduct its "genetic sequencing" and "virus isolation".

The director of the microbiology institute, Professor Wu-Chan Cao has the rank of colonel and is a Wuhan Institute of Virology board member in a clear conflict of interest.

Mr Canavan told Sky News commentator Sharri Markson he believed co-operation between Chinese government researchers and Australian scientists should be stopped.

"Your reports along with several other we have seen over the past year have raised serious concerns about the use with which joint research which occurs between China and other western nations is being put to for potentially military, counter intelligence applications and in this case in terms of health as well," Mr Canavan said.

"I think the reports are serious enough that we should suspend research co-operation with Chinese government-connected researchers." Senator Canavan said while there would be exceptions "if it's more general and non-urgent research we need to know a lot more about these connections and what use that such intellectual property is put to."
