ACTING Prime Minister Michael McCormack has backed World Health Organisation investigators to "get the answers they need" despite fears China will attempt to impede a probe into the coronavirus.

The World Health Organisation's (WHO) international team has touched down in Wuhan, China to investigate the origins of COVID-19, first detected in the city in late 2019.

Australia called for the investigation in April, a move widely viewed as triggering months of escalating trade tensions -between Canberra and Beijing.

Mr McCormack downplayed suggestions the WHO's arrival would hamper efforts to mend relations. "Our phone lines are always open, our doors are always open (to Beijing)," he said. "As far as diplomatic relations with China and trade are concerned, I know how important it is for producers â€¦ to ensure we continue our trade with China, which is worth $149.6 billion." Concerns have been raised over Beijing's willingness to allow a transparent investigation after it temporarily blocked investigators from entering, citing visa approval issues.

Mr McCormack would not be drawn on whether Beijing would attempt to impede the probe but backed WHO to conduct its work "very diligently".

"I'm sure that the WHO, being the robust organisation that it is, will make sure that its inquiries are what they need to be," he said. "They will â€¦ undertake their work in the most professional manner. I'm sure they'll come up with the answers they need." Mr McCormack also pushed back against one of the more bizarre salvos in the trade stoush after Beijing criticised Australian cherries for being "inferior â€¦ in taste and quality" compared with their Chilean equivalents.

"(Australian cherries) are the best. You want to get stuck into them, they're great: red, juicy and plump," he said. World page 72
