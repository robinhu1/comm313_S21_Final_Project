STATE of Origin will suffer a $5 million blow with the event's historic debut at Adelaide Oval this season destined for the scrapheap.

NRL innovation committee chairman Wayne Pearce says rugby league's inaugural Origin incursion into South Australia will almost certainly become a casualty of the coronavirus pandemic that has rocked world sport.

Despite Adelaide looking set to lose the 2020 series opener on June 3, Pearce is adamant Origin will be played this season. The South Australian government paid between $5 million and $8 million to snare Origin I, but a crowd lockout at Adelaide Oval to combat COVID-19 would rob the city of an estimated $15 million in tourism.

"The Adelaide game was heavily dependent on the South Australian government attracting tourist dollars for their economy," Pearce said. "But without a crowd I imagine it's not appealing for the -government."NSW would be favoured to receive two games this season because Queensland enjoyed a home-ground advantage at Suncorp Stadium in 2017.
