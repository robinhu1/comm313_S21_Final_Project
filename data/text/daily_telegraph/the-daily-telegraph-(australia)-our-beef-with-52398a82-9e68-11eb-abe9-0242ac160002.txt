OFFICIAL Australian analysis of the World Health Organisation (WHO) report into the origins of COVID-19 has rejected outright one of its central hypotheses that the virus might have been carried on imported frozen goods and originated outside China.

The WHO's month-long investigation into the pandemic's origins this week made several key but inconclusive findings, including the virus was active outside the Wuhan markets and could have been brought in from elsewhere "in South-East Asia". China's scientists had -earlier gone one step further, suggesting it may have been on imported seafood and beef from countries -including Australia, Brazil, India and the US.
