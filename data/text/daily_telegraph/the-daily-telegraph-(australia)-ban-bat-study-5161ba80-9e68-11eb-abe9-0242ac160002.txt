Exclusive: Lib MP calls for end to foreign research trips

A LIBERAL Senator has called for all virus research by foreign scientists in Australian laboratories to stop until a safety and national security review is done.

The call from Morrison government member Sarah Henderson follows revelations by The Daily Telegraph that the CSIRO's bio-containment facility in Geelong, Victoria has been engaging in research jointly funded by the Australian and Chinese governments.

The studies were in conjunction with the Wuhan Institute of Virology which is now at the centre of a global probe into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak.

"I am calling on the CSIRO's Australian Animal Health Laboratory - now known as the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness - to conduct a full review into its virus research program involving foreign nationals," she said.

Former Defence Minister and shadow cabinet member Joel Fitzgibbon backed the calls for an independent review last night.FULL REPORT PAGE 6
