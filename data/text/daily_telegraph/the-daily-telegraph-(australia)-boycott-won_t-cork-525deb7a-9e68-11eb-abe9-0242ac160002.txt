CHINESE Ambassador Cheng Jingye's threat of a consumer boycott of Australia will prove hollow, the wine industry says. But the seafood sector is worried.

As the Morrison government pressed for an international inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, Mr Cheng this week warned that "maybe the ordinary people will say 'Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?'." Wine and Grape Australia head Tony Battaglene said demand was already increasing and there was likely to be no fallout: "I think there is the potential for consumers to be influenced by that type of media, particularly in China. But I don't think it has happened in this instance." The only time he could recall a downturn linked to a political spat was in 2018 when there were accusations of Chinese spying. Australia's wine exports to China are worth $1.3 billion a year.But Seafood Industry Australia chairwoman Veronica Papacosta is concerned: "We think there is a high chance of an impact which we would not like to see." She said the abalone industry would be hit hardest because of its heavy reliance on the China market.
