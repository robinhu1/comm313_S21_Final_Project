THE World Health Organisation conceded its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic must be reviewed, as it continued to defend the way China managed the virus yesterday.

The regional director of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the Pacific Dr Takeshi Kasai (pictured) told a public briefing its expert committee had initially been divided on whether to declare the disease outbreak a public health emergency.

However, he said the organisation had been in constant contact with China after it revealed it had an outbreak of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause.

"We as organisations, we try our best to, as quickly as possible and then as transparently as possible to respond to these diseases but we have to review later and we need to be evaluated later," he said.

He defended China's transparency in sharing the make-up of the virus with WHO. The concession came as Prime Minister Scott Morrison has backed an independent international inquiry into the origins of coronavirus while claiming it would not be a criticism of China.

"It's not pursued as an issue of criticism, it's pursued as an issue of importance for public health," he said.

The WHO has come in for major criticism for being too slow to act and US President Donald Trump has withdrawn funding from the body claiming it was too China-centric.

The president has called for an investigation into whether the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.China has been criticised for initially suppressing information on the virus spread.
