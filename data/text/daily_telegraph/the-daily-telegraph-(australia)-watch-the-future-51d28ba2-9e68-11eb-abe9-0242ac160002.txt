THEY are the NRL stars of the future and their skills were on show for all to see yesterday.

There was Sandon Smith from St Edward's College, the dangerous back who was named in the 2019 under 18s NSW State of Origin squad. And Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School's Mitchell Henderson, the crafty playmaker who won last year's Harold Matthews Cup with the Newcastle Knights. Both youngsters lit up Tamworth on Wednesday, at the opening match of this year's prestigious NRL Schoolboys Cup.

Spectators are banned from attending matches, but thousands were able to watch the match through The Daily and Sunday Telegraph, which has secured exclusive rights to stream the Schoolboy Cup. Henderson crashed over three times for his school, but it was Smith's last-minute intercept try that saw underdogs St Edward's eliminate Ferrer 18-16 and proceed to the next round.

For 44 years, the competition has uncovered Australia's best rugby league talent - from Greg Alexander and Peter Sterling to Johnathan Thurston and James Tedesco.

This year, despite the challenges of COVID-19, the tournament has survived and will be played as a 14-round knockout. Today, St Dominic's College will line up against Patrician Brothers Blacktown at Windsor Leagues Club.

Both schools have produced some of the hottest rugby league talent in the country.

St Dominic's alumni include Nathan Cleary and Brad Fittler while Matt Lodge, Dallin Watene-Zelezniak and Stephen Crichton are PBB old boys.

St Dominics will field a young side with many players currently affiliated with the Penrith Panthers.

Jakob Arthur, the son of Parramatta Eels coach Brad Arthur, will steer the ship for PBB.
