ON State of Origin night Bruce the Australian cattle dog will run out the kicking tee for the NSW team.

But behind the scenes, while the 10-week-old pup is being trained for his debut with the NSW Blues at Origin 1 in November, he'll also provide valuable support for troubled teens.

NSW coach Brad Fittler said Bruce optimises the NSW spirit as his team aims to become the first Blues outfit to win three series in a row since 2005.

"The blue heeler breed is distinctly Australian and also stands for all the same qualities that NSW players do: mateship, loyalty, discipline and work ethic," Fittler said.

"It's been a difficult season as we've battled bushfires, floods and now a global pandemic over COVID-19.

"They say a dog is man's best friend and Bruce will certainly be a best friend for the Blues and all our fans in these tough times." NSWRL head of commercial and digital Jodie Cross said: "We wanted an official team mascot that would help us to create a legacy for future generations of Blues supporters.

"We looked at global sports and what was really appealing about all the teams that have live mascots is the strong connection it creates between the team and the community." Bruce will reside at RuffTrack Farm at Riverstone in Sydney's northwest after the NSWRL struck a partnership with the youth-based support program to have him work as a "therapy dog" with disengaged youths. Origin has come a long way since 1997, when then NSW coach Tommy Raudonikis issued the Blues a secret code - "cattle dog" - that signalled the moment to start an all-in brawl with Queensland, a punch-up enshrined in league history.
