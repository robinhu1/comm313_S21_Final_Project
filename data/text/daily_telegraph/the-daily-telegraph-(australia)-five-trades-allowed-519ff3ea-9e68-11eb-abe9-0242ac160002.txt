* KFC SuperCoaches will be given five trades for the upcoming Round 3, up from the normal two, to allow for changes in circumstances over the COVID-19 hiatus. The five-trade feature went live within the game on May 12.

* The overall number of 37 trades won't change despite the season being reduced from 25 to 20 rounds. This allows KFC SuperCoaches insurance against unforeseen issues (e.g. mass standing down of players).

* If users want to restart their draft league from scratch and do a redraft, they should contact Vapormedia directly (click "help" in the KFC SuperCoach game, then click "contact us").

* The KFC SuperCoach Stats free trial will be extended for another round (now finishes after Round 3), so make sure you check it out.

KFC SUPERCOACH CLASSIC * Team points for overall prizes and leagues to be carried over (no restart of points).

* Season reduced to 20 rounds in line with NRL (18 yet to be played). * Total of 37 trades to remain unchanged, five available ahead of round three (these five trades, if used, will come out of the 37 total). Essentially, Super Trade Week, which was originally scheduled for Round 15, has been brought forward as State of Origin will take place post-season and there are no bye rounds.

* At the end of Round 3, trades will move back to the usual two allowed per week.

* Bye rounds have been removed based on schedule expectation. * No change to 10- and 20-team league sizes, head-to-head game play to start in round three (as scheduled for 20-team leagues, to be implemented for 10-team leagues).

* Both league types play head to head (uneven draw) for rounds 3-16 (all rounds except the last four).

* Finals series to remain at four rounds - rounds 17-20.

* Player prices to be updated at the end of round three as previously scheduled.

KFC SUPERCOACH DRAFT * Leagues that extend beyond 20 rounds will be scaled back to fit within a 20-round season, including any finals series option as elected by any league.

* Skip bye rounds option has been removed to allow for maximum available rounds of game play, given there are no bye-impacted rounds expected under the revised fixture.

* Game play otherwise continues as usual. As per above, users can contact Vapormedia via the "contact us" form within KFC SuperCoach to redraft and restart leagues if they wish (which would void rounds 1 and 2).

IMPORTANT NOTES * The above changes are subject to any alterations to the proposed NRL schedule. * Ã®The changes are still to be reflected in the competition terms and conditions. * The changes, including the five-trade feature for the upcoming round, was implemented to the product on May 12.
