AFTER more than a month in quarantine, 49 crew members disembarked the Ruby Princess at Port Kembla yesterday.

A team of rescuers including police, the Australian Defence Force and medical staff, were met with cheers from crew on their balconies, some banging pots and flying flags. One man was so relieved to finally be off the ship, he performed a haka and jumped into the air, waving goodbye to those left on board.

The crew members - from the US, UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada and Japan - were bussed to hotels in Sydney where they will remain until their flights home in the next three days.

"I never thought the day would come, I've been in the cabin for about a month now," one woman said.

Luggage was sprayed with disinfectant and the crew were given temperature checks before being allowed to leave the ship.

One of the group, who has tested positive for COVID-19, will be quarantined in a NSW Health managed hotel for 14 days before flying home, police said.

On Monday, 19 more crew on the ship tested positive, taking the total number to 190.There are still a large number of crew on board who will tomorrow return with the ship to its point of origin in the Philippines.
