ST George Dragons star Jack de Belin could be sidelined for his second full season after his sexual assault case was again adjourned.

A decision on complex pre-trial arguments is still weeks away, meaning the trial might not proceed until November. De Belin's contract with the Dragons is due to expire at the end of this year.

While the former NSW Origin star hasn't been able to play for more than a year, he has still been able to train with the team and has been receiving his full pay.

De Belin and co-accused Callan Sinclair have pleaded not guilty to five charges of aggravated sexual assault, after they were accused of assaulting a woman, 19, in December 2018.

De Belin became the first player to be sidelined under the NRL's no-fault stand down policy, which stops players facing serious criminal charges taking the field.

His trial was supposed to start on February 3 this year but the two weeks allotted for the trial were taken up by legal argument.

The case was adjourned to April but was again pushed back due to COVID-19, with the case finally recommencing last Monday. By Friday afternoon, de Belin's barrister and the Crown prosecutor were yet to finish their submissions, forcing Judge Andrew Haesler to set aside more time in July for arguments to wrap up.
