TIES between Australian researchers and the Chinese military need to be stopped in the interests of national security, according to National Party Senator Matt Canavan.

He said recent reports within Australia and from around the world had raised serious concerns about co-operation with Chinese government-connected researchers.

An exclusive report in The Daily Telegraph recently outlined how China's People's Liberation Army has been involved in scientific research, co-funded by the Australian government, into the origins of the coronavirus which has been published in esteemed medical journals.

In an explosive revelation, a study co-funded by the Australian Research Council and the Chinese government, and trumpeted by The University of Sydney as helping to solve the puzzle of how COVID-19 transferred from animals to humans, relied on a key laboratory in an institute in the People's Liberation Army's Academy of Military Medical Sciences to conduct its "genetic sequencing" and "virus isolation". The director of the microbiology institute, Professor Wu-Chan Cao has the rank of colonel and is a Wuhan Institute of Virology board member. Mr Canavan told Sky News commentator Sharri Markson co-operation between Chinese government researchers and Australian scientists should be stopped. "Your reports along with several others ... over the past year have raised serious concerns about (how) the ... joint research between China and other western nations is being (used) for potentially military, counter intelligence applications and in this case, in terms, of health as well," Mr Canavan said. "I think the reports are serious enough that we should suspend research co-operation with Chinese government-connected researchers."
