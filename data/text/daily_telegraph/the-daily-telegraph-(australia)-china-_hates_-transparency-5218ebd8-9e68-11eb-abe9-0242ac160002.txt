CHINA'S secretive response to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted an "allergy to transparency" which Australia was right to challenge, according to acting US Ambassador -Michael Goldman.

Mr Goldman said the Morrison Government should be "commended" for taking on China. China retaliated with a series of escalating trade strikes. "I think it shows, unfortunately, that while China's made some strides in this regard, there still is an impulse towards secrecy and an allergy to transparency," he said.
