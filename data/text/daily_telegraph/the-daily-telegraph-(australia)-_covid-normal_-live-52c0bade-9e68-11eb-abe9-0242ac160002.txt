LIVE venues will soon host crowds at 75 per cent capacity in states recording no locally acquired COVID-19 cases for a fortnight.

The federal government yesterday unveiled its live performance road map, outlining plans for what it calls a "COVID normal" in states that bring the virus under control.

The roadmap has been agreed to by National Cabinet and provides a three-step outline for how the sector can operate in a COVID-safe way.

Indoor and outdoor seated events will be able to reach three-quarters capacity but will remain ticketed only. The eased restrictions do not apply to some larger events, with outdoor festivals subject to strict controls and approvals.

The eased restrictions will come into effect in states that have gone 14 days without a locally acquired coronavirus case.

But with events in Queensland, including Wednesday's State of Origin decider, already hosting full capacities, Arts Minister Paul Fletcher rejected claims the roadmap should have been released earlier. He said the news was welcome relief for a sector hard hit by coronavirus. The announcement came alongside confirmation $60m of the government's arts rescue package had begun to flow immediately. Grants of between $50,000 and $2m had been allocated to 115 projects
