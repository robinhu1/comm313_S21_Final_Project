A WORLD Health Organisation investigation into the origins of COVID-19 - first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan more than a year ago - has failed to get off the ground with the UN body complaining that Beijing was blocking its team from entering the country.

The WHO announced that after months of preparation, its experts had begun travelling to China - only to be told that there were problems with their visas. "I am very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a rare castigation of Beijing.

A 10-strong team was due to arrive in China this week after months of painstaking negotiations.

Beijing is determined to control the origin story of the virus, which has killed more than 1.8 million people so far.

The first cases of the coronavirus were recorded in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, prompting accusations of chaotic, secretive handling by Chinese authorities which led to its spread beyond China.

But Beijing has so far resisted pressure for a full independent probe into the early days of the outbreak. Instead, it has seeded doubt as to whether the pandemic even started inside its borders at all.

The WHO mission was billed as a way to cut through the rancour and seek clear answers on how the virus jumped from animals to humans. But with some of the team already in transit, Beijing had yet to grant them entry, the WHO chief confirmed.
