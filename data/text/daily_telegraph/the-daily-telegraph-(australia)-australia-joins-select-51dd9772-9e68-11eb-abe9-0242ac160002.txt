AUSTRALIA'S success flattening the coronavirus curve has prompted an invite to a special group for nations moving to reopen their economy.

The group - known as the "first movers" - is made up of countries deemed to have achieved relative success suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic and are now focused on easing restrictions.

Australia was invited to the group by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz (pictured) and joins an eclectic collection of countries including Denmark, Israel, New Zealand, Greece and the Czech Republic.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison dialled into the group's second official meeting last night to share Australia's progress in combating the health crisis and its plans to reopen parts of the economy.

It is understood international leaders have been particularly interested in Australia's success building up a strong testing and contact tracing capacity - including through the COVIDSafe app - as well as the co-operation achieved through the National Cabinet. While the group is yet to discuss Australia's hopes for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is understood the idea has broad support as the European nations already have a similar motion going to the World Health Assembly this month.

Australia will support the EU-sponsored draft resolution on the "COVID-19 Response" and its call for an independent evaluation to consolidate lessons from the pandemic, when it goes before the Assembly on May 18.China has lashed out at the calls by Australia for a review into the origins of the crisis.
