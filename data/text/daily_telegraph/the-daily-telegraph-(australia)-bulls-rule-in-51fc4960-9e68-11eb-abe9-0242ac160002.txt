MARKETS Cautious optimism among experts

Leading fund managers and advisers to the nation's rich---listers are cautiously optimistic about the economic outlook for 2021, with value stocks exposed to the Australian housing market and local economy tipped to outperform.

After central banks rushed to slash interest rates across the world and $20 trillion in monetary and fiscal stimulus provided by governments globally in 2020, sharemarkets are expected to continue their upward trajectory in 2021.

The comments came as Australian shares ended a tumultuous year by almost wiping out the year's losses, while the Aussie dollar has surged back above US77c.

The S&P/ASX 200 closed on a weaker note on Thursday, finishing a shortened session down 1.43 per cent, or 95.3 points, at 6587.10. This took total losses for the calendar year to 1.45 per cent, but marked a stunning recovery from the global market shocks inflicted early in the year by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The benchmark ended down 8 per cent from its record closing high on February 20, but surged 45 per cent from its COVID-savaged low of just 4546 points on March 23.

Information technology was the biggest moving sector in the local market, up 57 per cent on the year, followed by materials - which covers the big miners of BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue - up 14.6 per cent. Banks and financials were down 7.5 per cent, while Energy - which covers oil and gas producers - was off 29 per cent.

The biggest mover in the S&P/ASX 200 was buy now, pay later juggernaut Afterpay. up more than 300 per cent to $118, followed by online retailer Kogan, up 150 per cent to $19. Miners Mineral Resources rallied 127 per cent to $37.45 and Fortescue 119 per cent to $23.43 on the back of a surge in iron ore prices.

The worst hit on the benchmark index were travel stocks, with Flight Centre down 60 per cent on the year to $15.85, while shopping mall operator Unibail-Westfield was down 54 per cent to $5.10 and Webjet was off 46 per cent to $5.07.

Paul Skamvougeras, head of equities at Perpetual Investments, said the current Australian market valuation was expensive relative to history and the risk was that the anticipated rebound in earnings post the COVID pandemic did not eventuate as expected.

"The biggest tail risk for markets is rising interest rates driven by inflation. Although a low probability, this would impact high asset prices," he said.

Perpetual was cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the Australian economy for 2021, he said.

"Given our view on the economy, we are invested in domestic Aussie cyclicals such as builders and banks. We expect the Australian dollar to be strong and are underweight US dollar earners," he said.

"As the economy rebounds in 2021 and corporate confidence returns we expect to see large-scale merger and acquisition activity, driven by historically low borrowing costs." Geoff Wilson, chairman and founder of $3.5bn fund Wilson Asset Management, said the sectors representing value in the Australian market in 2021 would be domestic tourism, housing and infrastructure. "The housing sector will be driven by a combination of record low interest rates, government stimulus measures and improving consumer confidence, to underpin both new and existing dwelling demand," he said.

"Companies we like here include Ingenia Communities, Fletcher Building, Brickworks, Reliance Worldwide, Australian Finance Group and Johns Lyng. A number of these companies will benefit from additional tailwinds provided by infrastructure-related fiscal measures, along with Downer and Maas Group." Tom Millner, director and portfolio manager at Contact Asset Management, said he would maintain his focus in 2021 on quality companies with sustainable dividends and growing earnings. "We are going to see, we think, some good results out of the better quality companies like Woolworths, Wesfarmers, CBA, ARB, Reece, Resmed and Harvey Norman," he said.

"And alignment is a big theme in these environments. You want management and the board to own shares in the companies because they are representing the shareholders and their best interests are of the shareholders and when they are shareholders themselves they tend to make sensible decisions about acquisitions, debt levels and payout ratios." Armytage Private portfolio director Bradley King said it was unlikely that the boom from mid 2020 to the end of the year could be repeated.

But Mr King said some resources stocks could continue to do well in 2021, especially those minerals exposed to battery use such as lithium and nickel.
