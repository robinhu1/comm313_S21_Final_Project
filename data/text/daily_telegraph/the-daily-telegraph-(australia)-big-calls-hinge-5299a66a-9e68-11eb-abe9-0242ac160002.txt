THE NRL will be forced to wait up to three weeks before being able to finalise four of the biggest decisions confronting 2020.

Despite entering Round 13 in the first week of August, the NRL and ARL Commission boss Peter V'landys remain powerless to reach any major decision on State of Origin and the grand final due to Melbourne's COVID-19 outbreak.

The final decisions may not be reached until early September. The ARL Commission is still unable to determine: ^ Whether this year grand final will be played in Sydney?

^ What venue the grand final will be contested?

^ Whether State of Origin I will still be played in Adelaide? ^ What alternate venue would be chosen if Adelaide was to be cancelled. The NRL will wait another two to three weeks to determine the full impact Victoria's coronavirus breakout may have had in NSW.

COVID infections data this month will show the NRL, whether NSW faces renewed sanctions. Until then, the NRL cannot push ahead with key decisions for later this season.

Just three weeks ago, the NRL had planned for full crowds returning to the grounds on August 1.

One well-placed source said: "The NRL can't make any decision with any certainty for two to three weeks until the virus is contained or eradicated. Things are changing so quickly." Provided NSW infection rates remain low, the grand final will be played in Sydney. Should those levels increase significantly, there is a chance the decider could be moved to Brisbane, Perth or even New Zealand.
