A POWERFUL British -politician has been seeking support from Australia for a co-ordinated "rethink" by western countries to their "unbalanced relationship" with China after it covered up the coronavirus pandemic.

Iain Duncan Smith (pictured), a former Conservative Party leader, has been putting in the foundations for a new approach to China after the disaster of COVID-19. The China hawk said he had been talking to Australian politicians about his campaign for a tougher line on the -Communist nation.

"There needs to be a complete rethink on our unbalanced relationship with China," he said.

And he said it was inevitable that there would be an -independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, which Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded."I'm sure there will be a full inquiry and there will be a full inquiry into the behaviour of the World Health Organisation in the early months, but that's a matter for the -government," he said.
