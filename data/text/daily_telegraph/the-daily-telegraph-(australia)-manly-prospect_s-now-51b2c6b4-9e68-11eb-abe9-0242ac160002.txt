ONE of Manly's brightest prospects is on the verge of making his long-awaited NRL debut - for a rival club.

Sea Eagles young gun Albert Hopoate will move to the New Zealand Warriors on a four-week loan.

Tipped to make his NRL debut as an 18-year-old in 2019, Hopoate was robbed of the chance when he ruptured his ACL, for the second time, playing SG Ball.

After recovering from a knee reconstruction, Hopoate's chances of pushing for a Sea Eagles debut were cruelled by the disruption to the 2020 season because of COVID-19.

"We're delighted to have Albert on board. He was a prodigious talent coming through the junior grades, representative sides and Origin age teams for New South Wales," Warriors recruitment manager Peter O'Sullivan said. "Unfortunately, injury has curtailed his NRL aspirations so far but we are looking forward to seeing him play for the Vodafone Warriors. "Albert is a player who can handle fullback, wing and centre, and is uncanny in his likeness to older brother Will."
