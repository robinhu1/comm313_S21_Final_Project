Here's how some of game's biggest names moved away from the coaching cauldron GARTH BRENNAN â–  Gold Coast (2018-19) â–  Win record:30% Axed after 12 wins from 40 games following a review by Gold Coast head of performance and culture Mal Meninga. Brennan dusted himself off to secure work at the NRL, reviewing the performance of referees at the beginning of this year before he was a victim of the COVID-19 crisis that led to job cuts. The 48-year-old returned home to Newcastle where he's a budding real estate agent and property investor.

BRIAN SMITH â–  Illawarra (1984-87), St George (1991-95), Parramatta (1997-2006), Newcastle (2007-09), Roosters (2010-12) â–  Win record: 52.7% Sacked with a year remaining on his contract at the end of 2012 by the Roosters, Smith spent 36 years in the game as a coach. He was general manager of the Warriors for two years, with the 66-year-old let go last November. He has been working in his spare time as an Uber driver in Brisbane.

ANTHONY GRIFFIN â–  Brisbane (2011-14), Penrith (2016-18) â–  Win record: 55.5% Controversially sacked at Penrith just four weeks out from the 2018 finals.

Offers mentoring and one-on-one coaching to business leaders. Also a member of 2GB's Continuous Call Team.

IVAN HENJAK â–  Brisbane (2009-10) â–  Win record: 52.9% 'Where's Wally' is easier to find than the former Broncos coach. Not even senior members of Brisbane management have heard from Henjak in years. The 57-year-old was axed three weeks before the start of the 2011 season. From the glamour of coaching one of Australia's biggest clubs, Henjak filled his time laying artificial turf, selling beds and coaching the Sunshine Coast Falcons in 2014 - only to quit 10 games into the season.

GEOFF TOOVEY â–  Manly (2012-15) â–  Win record: 58.1% Has made no secret of his desire to continue NRL coaching, having applied for the Warriors job this year. 'Tooves" is an astute judge of football having coached Manly to the 2013 grand final and making regular appearances on Fox League. Every other day, he catches the bus from Sydney's Northern Beaches into the city to work as a chartered accountant.

He is also a member of the commentary team for ABC Grandstand.

BRIAN McCLENNAN â–  Warriors (2012) â–  Win record: 36.4% McClennan coached the Hibiscus Raiders in Auckland's Fox Memorial premiership last year but, following his elderly father Mike's disappearance and death last year, decided he would retire from coaching. Together with his family, 'Bluey' devotes much of his time to supporting Dementia Auckland. He also runs Kaspa Transmissions, a transmissions repair business, outside of Auckland.

KEVIN MOORE â– Canterbury (2009-11) â– Win record: 53% Cut by the Bulldogs midway through the 2011 season, Moore teamed up with brother-in-law and former Canterbury coach Chris Anderson to create a recruitment company, Anderson Recruitment and Training, where he's business development manager.

NEIL HENRY â–  Canberra (2007-08), North Queensland (2009-13), Gold Coast (2014-17) â–  Win record: 43.5% Current head coach of the Junior Kangaroos.

PHIL ECONOMIDIS â–  Gold Coast (1996-98) â–  Win record: 31.3% He famously led the ragtag Gold Coast Chargers to the 1997 ARL finals, a remarkable achievement given the side was assembled from discards from rival clubs. In March, Economidis, 67, was set to be appointed as head coach of Red Star Belgrade, a Serbian footy club seeking entry into the English Super League's Challenge Cup, until COVID-19 forced the pause of the competition.

STUART RAPER â–  Cronulla (2004-06) â–  Win record: 42.5% Raper and wife Cathy bought a formal wear hire company, Formal Wear 2 Suit U, only a month before he was let go by Cronulla. The company is thriving today. Raper's main line of work is for the NSWRL as referee high performance manager, overseeing grade and junior representative squads.

ROYCE SIMMONS â–  Penrith (1994-2001) â–  Win record: 41.8% Living proof that your character will always be your greatest selling-point. Simmons has worked with the Panthers sponsorship and corporate hospitality team since he finished coaching in 2012. He can host up to 60 events a year for Penrith's major sponsors.

MARK MURRAY â–  Roosters (1991-94), Melbourne (2001-02) â–  Win record: 41.9% A qualified teacher, the former Queensland State of Origin, Roosters and Melbourne coach is now in his sixth year as a real estate agent.

JASON TAYLOR â–  Parramatta (2006), South Sydney (2007-09), Wests Tigers (2015-17) â–  Win record: 43.6% From his acrimonious departure at the Tigers, 'JT' secured an assistant role at the Roosters in 2017, before taking over as head coach of NSW Cup feeder club North Sydney in 2018. He's contracted to the Bears until the end of 2021 and works one-on-one with the Roosters' goalkickers, including Kyle Flanagan.

DANIEL ANDERSON â–  Warriors (2001-04), Parramatta (2009-10) â–  Win record: 52.8% Had grand final appearances with Parramatta and the Warriors before winning a premiership with St Helens in the UK. He coached the Kiwi Test team before overseeing the NRL's referees in 2012. A move back to the Eels in 2013 as their GM of football would prove tumultuous, resulting in a two-year ban from the game for his role in the Eels' 2016 salary cap scandal. Currently head of recruitment at the Roosters.

JOHN LANG â–  Cronulla (1994-2001), Penrith (2002-06), South Sydney (2010-11) â–  Win record: 53.8% Had a major impact on the Sharks' consistent finals appearances, including the 1997 Super League grand final.

DAVID WAITE â– Newcastle (1991-94), St George (1996-98), St George-Illawarra (1999-2000) â– Win record: 51.6% The 1996 Dally M coach of the year took St George to the 1996 grand final and the merged St George Illawarra to the 1999 grand final. Waite was then controversially replaced by Andrew Farrar halfway through the 2000 season. Had stints with the Great Britain rugby league team as coaching director from 2001-03, as the head coach of Catalans for five games in 2006, before returning as an assistant in 2014. These days, he's providing tutelage to junior rugby league coaches at Runaway Bay in Queensland.

ARTHUR KITINAS â–  South Sydney (2004) â–  Win record: 23.1% Took over his father's tyre shop in Marrickville after leaving Souths, where he works today. Kitinas is still in the game as a development coach for the Roosters' Harold Matthews and SG Ball sides.
