SYDNEY'S top private schools have been forced to ban parents from attending sport events this weekend in order to meet strict COVID-19 conditions imposed by venues across NSW.

The Athletic Association of Greater Public Schools (AAGPS) had to cut crowds at yesterday's Convenors Swimming Invitational at Sydney Olympic Park and at today's St Joseph's College Regatta at the Sydney International -Regatta Centre.

The announcement - a week after more than 36 000 spectators were permitted to gather and watch the State of Origin Game 2 at ANZ Stadium - frustrated parents. To add to confusion, some school summer fixtures had been able to host limited spectators at school venues.

The AAGPS, however, had no choice but to comply with the specific capacity limitations and conditions of each sporting venue selected by the participating schools. "The allowance of spectators at all other summer sporting fixtures will remain the responsibility of individual member schools and will vary between indoor and outdoor venues and individual school facility capacities" the AAGPS said. The swimming and rowing will be lifestreamed.
