Aussie link to China military lab

CHINA'S People's Liberation Army has been involved in scientific research - co-funded by the Australian government - into the origins of the coronavirus.

In an explosive revelation, a study co-funded by the Australian Research Council and the Chinese government - and trumpeted by The University of Sydney as helping to unlock the genetic code of COVID-19 - relied on a laboratory in the People's Liberation Army's Academy of Military Medical Sciences to conduct its "genetic sequencing" and "virus isolation".

The director of this institute, Professor Wu-Chan Cao, who is thanked in the paper's acknowledgments for his "substantial contribution", has the rank of colonel and is also a Wuhan Institute of Virology board member - the same facility which is at the centre of a global probe into whether the naturally-occurring coronavirus was accidentally released from its laboratory or came from a local wet market. The study includes one of two scientific papers on the coronavirus undertaken by University of Sydney virologist and evolutionary biologist, Professor Edward Holmes.FULL REPORT PAGES 4-5
