THE Prime Minister has dec-lared Australia's democracy "is not up for trade" after China -issued a laundry list of sins it says Australia has committed, including seeking an investigation into the origin of COVID-19 and speaking up on human rights.

It comes as the Five Eyes -intelligence nations, including Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Canada and US, issued a joint statement condemning China for disqualifying several Hong Kong politicians in what it called "a concerted campaign to silence all critical voices".

China released a list of issues it claims have damaged the trade relationship it has with Australia, ranging from rejecting Chinese bids to building the 5G network, speaking out on Hong Kong's democracy and human rights abuses in Xinjian; linking cyber attacks in Australia to China; and introducing foreign influence laws.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday said Australia was not making China the enemy, but that our nation would not compromise on its national interests either.

"We will respect the decisions of other countries, but our values aren't up for trade. Our democracy is not up for trade and our sovereignty is not up for trade," he said.

"We won't be compromising on the fact we will set what our foreign investment laws are or how we build our 5G telecommunications networks or how we run our systems protecting against interference in the way we run our country." The statement from Five Eyes said China's actions in Hong Kong had breached its obligations under the legally-binding Sino-British joint declaration, from the handover of the autonomous region in 1997.
