CHINA may have fudged its COVID-19 death figures by tens of thousands, according to figures which tracked crematory operations in Wuhan earlier this year.

A study published on the preprint server medRxiv claims the official Chinese statistics on COVID-19 cases and the country's mortality may not be accurate.

The study looked at investigative media reports of crematory operations in Wuhan - the origin and -epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The estimates of cumulative deaths, based on both -funeral urns distribution and continuous full capacity operation of cremation services up to March 23 give results around 36,000 - more than 10 times of the official death toll of 2524," states the report. â€ƒ"Our study indicates a significant under-reporting in Chinese official data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan.

"The magnitude of discrepancy between our estimates based on cremation related data and Chinese -official figures in early February - the critical time for -response to the COVID-19 pandemic - suggests the need to re-evaluate official statistics from China and -consider all available and reasonable data sources for a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic." It comes as an antibody study by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested nearly half a million residents in Wuhan may have been -infected with COVID-19 - 10 times the official number.
