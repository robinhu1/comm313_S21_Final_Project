CHINESE threats to boycott Australian exports if the Morrison government continues to pursue an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic have been dismissed as support for an -investigation remains strong.

China's ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye said the Chinese public was dismayed at Australia's push for an independent inquiry into the COVID-19 outbreak and might consider boycotting major exports including beef and wine. He also said Chinese students may no longer travel to study in Australia.

"The parents of the students would also think whether this place which they found is not so friendly, even hostile, whether this is the best place to send their kids (to Australia)," he told the Australian Financial Review. "It is up to the people to decide. Maybe the ordinary people will say 'Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?'" But Labor's Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong backed the government's call for an independent inquiry.

"The Chinese ambassador spoke about not wanting to resort to recrimination, division, and suspicion," she said.

"That is precisely the reason why we want to make sure the international community can be assured that we get to the bottom of the origin of the virus."Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt said an independent inquiry was in the interests of Australia and the world. "We've seen â€¦ over 200,000 lives lost so of course there has to be an independent review," Mr Hunt told the ABC.
