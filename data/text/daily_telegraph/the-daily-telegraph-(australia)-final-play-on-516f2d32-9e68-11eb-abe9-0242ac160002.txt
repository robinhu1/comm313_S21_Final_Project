DONALD Trump could reveal critical intelligence linking the COVID-19 pandemic to a secret lab in Wuhan in his final days as US president.

The Sun reports the outgoing president could play one final hand in the international investigation of the virus' origins, with Mr Trump reportedly looking to declassify evidence gathered by US operatives revealing the lab as the pandemic's origin point. It's believed Mr Trump may also release information from US intelligence operatives revealing alleged links between Wuhan scientists and the Chinese Army. A well placed diplomatic source told The Sun: "The US have stopped short of this so far but anything could happen in the coming days." A UK government source added there has been "increasing chatter" that Mr Trump and his top diplomat Mike Pompeo were planning a broadside against the Chinese Communist Party over their handling of the outbreak.
