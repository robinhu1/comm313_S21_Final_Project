ACADEMIC research into the origins of coronavirus will have to be vetted by government officials before it can be published, according to a disturbing report from China.

Two Chinese universities posted government directives stipulating all research into the origins of the virus were to be vetted by authorities.

The online posts by Fudan University in Shanghai and China University of Geoscience in Wuhan were deleted after CNN made inquiries. Cached versions of the documents remain online.

The directives mandate that papers on the origin of COVID-19 be "strictly and tightly managed", involving oversight from the university administration and a task force of the State Council, according to CNN.

Professor Clive Hamilton (left), author of the book Silent Invasion: China's InfluenceIn Australia, said the directive follows earlier propaganda efforts by Beijing to "control the narrative" by promulgating "outlandish theories" about the origin of the virus. According to one of these stories, the virus was brought to China by US troops, while according to another the virus originated in Italy.

"It's very consistent with the news that we've been getting out of China for a couple of months now," he said.

"Chinese scientists have been publishing world-leading information on the virus, its nature and it origin, and they have been silenced and disciplined. Some have gone off the radar, so that has meant that the world is deprived of important information about COVID-19."The reported origin of COVID-19 in the live animal markets of Wuhan has proved a touchy issue for Beijing, with US President Donald Trump's repeated use of the term "Chinese virus" in press conferences prompting a telephone call from Chinese President Xi Jinping on March 26.
