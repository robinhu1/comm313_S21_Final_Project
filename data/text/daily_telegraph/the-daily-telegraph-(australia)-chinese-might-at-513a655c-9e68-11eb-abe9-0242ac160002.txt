PERTH's newly minted mus-eum has removed a reference to China from its COVID-19 exhibit after a complaint from the Chinese consul -general.

The Western Australian Museum Boola Bardip multimedia display had described coronavirus as "originating in mainland China".

WA Museum chief executive Alec Coles confirmed there had been a complaint. "The museum was â€¦ contacted by the acting consul-general in Perth about the factual errors, and we were pleased to advise the mistakes were immediately rectified," he said.

The museum has also changed a reference to the -island of Taiwan being -independent.

"A map has been updated to reflect Australian government policy," the museum said on social media.

The exhibit is housed in the Tianqi Lithium Collections Gallery, named after the Chinese mining company which donated $5 million to the museum in 2017.

Members of the mining company's board attended the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party, which is a university for the country's leaders.

In a social media post, the museum said it sought -"authenticity and accuracy" in all work. "One label stated that COVID-19 originated in mainland China," the mus-eum said. "The World Health Organisation is still investigating its origin, therefore this reference has been -updated." Australia has recognised Taiwan as being part of China since 1972.
