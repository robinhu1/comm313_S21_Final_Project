SYDNEY criminals are getting caught with millions in cash as the pandemic shatters their efforts to launder money through casinos and poker machines, NSW Police and other law enforcement agencies said.

In the latest seizure, police allegedly found $1m (pictured) in cash at the East Hills home of a relative of a Middle Eastern crime family after they stopped his car on Friday afternoon in Riverwood. Police also allegedly found cocaine and $120,000 in cash hidden in secret compartments in the car.

"It appears criminals are holding a lot more cash at the moment as they can't launder their money in traditional means because of the restrictions placed on them by COVID-19," Detective Superintendent Martin Fileman of the NSW Organised Crime Squad said. "We are catching people with cash more frequently from amounts of tens of thousands of dollars up to the millions." Border closures have also hit crime syndicates who often move money interstate to clean cash.

Det. Supt. Fileman said there are now huge amounts of cash sitting in homes and storage facilities waiting to be laundered.

"The amount in those units would run into the hundreds of millions," he said. Other senior law enforcement officers told The Telegraph that a drop in foreign students has also hampered laundering syndicates.

"Foreign students are often used to remit money to overseas bank accounts and then transferred back in a variety of ways in an attempt to hide its origins," the officer said.

He said it also could explain the recent spike in gangsters kidnapping each other and holding them for ransom. "They know that they are having problems moving cash so that makes them very attractive targets for extortion," he said.
