HARBOUR OPERATION IN the largest peacetime maritime operation ever undertaken on Sydney Harbour, police and port officials began yesterday to move 1300 crew members between five stricken cruise liners.

The ships and government have been in a stalemate after the vessels were banned from docking due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Five Royal Carribean cruise liners were involved.

The ships were refuelled and restocked with food and medical supplies before they left.

Crew members are also being allowed to move onto ships heading closest to their countries of origin.

"More than 600 crew members, who are foreign nationals, were moved between the two ships in numerous tender operations, before both ships departed NSW waters to return to their home countries," a spokesman said. Another three ships with 780 crew will be moved today.Ovation of the Seas has been linked to 84 cases of COVID-19 among passengers, while 39 cases, including five crew, were aboard Voyager of the Seas. Another 12 passengers from Celebrity Solstice have tested positive. The Ruby Princess, last night in the Tasman Sea off Sydney, has more than 1000 crew being checked.
