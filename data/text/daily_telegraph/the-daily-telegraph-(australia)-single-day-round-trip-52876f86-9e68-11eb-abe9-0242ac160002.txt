ADELAIDE is set to be confirmed as the destination for the opening game of the State of Origin series and for the first time in history, the sides may fly in and fly out on the day of the game.

Officials from Queensland and NSW met with NRL and biosecurity experts on Friday morning as they began the process of planning for the most unique series in Origin's 40-year history.

It is understood the NRL is still committed to playing the opening game of the series in Adelaide, although that will present its own set of problems and no doubt require delicate negotiations with the South Australian government over protocols for the game, as well as how many people will be permitted through the gates.

The states also need to finalise talks with the players union over squad sizes and their pay packets. The initial thought was that each state could select a squad of up to 24 players for the Origin series, although there are genuine concerns even that may not be enough.

NSW used 25 players last year and the injury rate has increased exponentially in the NRL this year, suggesting the Origin depth will be stretched over a three-game series that has been -restricted to a period of three weeks.

It would be naive to think it won't be the same through the Origin series, particularly if players are forced to make rapid-fire visits to the respective host cities due to state protocols.

The players also need to decide how they will divvy up their pay packets for the series. Origin players have traditionally received $30,000 per game but there is no doubt that figure will be slashed due to the fallout from COVID-19.

Origin sides have traditionally spent the days leading into Origin promoting the game in the local destination. There is every chance they won't be able to do that in Adelaide due to the state government protocols. Instead, they may be required to fly in on the day of the game and depart immediately after. - THE AUSTRALIAN
