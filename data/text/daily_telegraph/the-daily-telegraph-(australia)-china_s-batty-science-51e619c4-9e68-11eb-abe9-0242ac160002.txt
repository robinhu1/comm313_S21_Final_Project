WORLD EXCLUSIVE Government dossier reveals virus cover-up

THE Australian government trained and employed a team of Chinese scientists, whose laboratory is now the subject of a probe into the origins of COVID-19.

The laboratory genetically modified deadly coronaviruses that could be transmitted from bats to humans, causing illness that had no cure.

A dossier compiled by Western governments and obtained by The Saturday Telegraph features the Wuhan lab now at the centre of intelligence agencies' investigations to determine if an accidental release caused the coronavirus pandemic.

The laboratory, led by scientist Shi Zhengli, and its research feature in the dossier, which points to several studies they conducted as areas of concern.

It cites the lab's work discovering samples of coronavirus from a bat cave in China with a striking genetic similarity to COVID-19, along with research synthesising a bat-derived coronavirus that could not be treated.

The document lays the foundation for accusing China of a general cover-up, stating it deliberately engaged in the "suppression and destruction of evidence", in an "assault on international transparency" and to the "endangerment- of other countries".SPECIAL REPORT PAGES 6-9
