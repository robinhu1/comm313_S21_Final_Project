If you likedâ€¦ THE THICK OF IT Tryâ€¦ FLACK STREAMING, FOXTEL NOW 7.30PM, MONDAY, FOX ONE THE final episode of season two of this brilliantly wicked drama drops this week, and I'll be sorry to see it go. Fans of this series, who found the heady mix of celebrity scandal and deeply dysfunctional people paid to cover for them intoxicating, will have to wait to see if this is going to a season three (possibly on Amazon Prime, which picked Flack up after Viacom incomprehensively dropped it a week before season two started). Besides the strong performance by lead Anna Paquin, the highlight so far this season has been the addition of Sam Neill, who found a match on screen with Sophie Okonedo as Paquin's boss, Caroline. His character, Duncan, was suitably shocking, boasting he'd "once snorted a gram of cocaine off Kylie Minogue's bottom and then rode a Shetland pony into a swimming pool". It's a scene Neill thought would end up on the cutting room floor, telling one UK paper: "Kylie's a friend of mine, and I thought she wouldn't mind, but perhaps she'll take terrible exception to it. Still, she does have a famously good bottom. I was worried they'd cut it out." - Holly Byrnes

DRAMA THE SINNER: JAMIE STREAMING, NETFLIX DETECTIVE Harry Ambrose (Bill Pullman, pictured) returns for season three of this brilliant crime anthology, which sets him a whole new mystery to solve. The new episodes star Matt Bomer as Jamie Burns, an expectant father and Dorchester resident who seeks Harry's support after a fatal car accident in Upstate New York reveals a much larger and more disturbing case behind it. Bomer is bone-chillingly good. - HB

KIDS ODD SQUAD 4.30PM, SUNDAY, ABC ME IF, like me, you are mathematically challenged, it might be an idea to make a date to watch this clever live action series, which sees a crack squad of spies investigate strange happenings in their town. The child actors use mathematical concepts (addition, multiplication, using data in graphs, etc.) to advance each episode's plot; but it also parodies the police procedural. Smart and educational. - HB

If you likedâ€¦ THE AMERICANS Tryâ€¦ PERRY MASON STREAMING, FOXTEL NOW 11AM AND 8.30PM, MONDAY, FOX SHOWCASE BRACE for a grim start to this dark and moody remake of the 1950s classic legal drama, reimagined with The Americans star Matthew Rhys in the role played famously by Raymond Burr. I can't say too much as HBO are keeping the plot twists under wraps, only adding to the suspense of this series; but the light and shade in the first episode was clever and kept tight. Set in 1932 Los Angeles, the series will focus on the origin story of famed defence lawyer Perry Mason, based on characters from Erle Stanley Gardner's novels. Living pay-cheque-to-pay-cheque as a low-rent private investigator, Mason is haunted by his wartime experiences in France and is suffering the effects of a broken marriage. LA is booming while the rest of the country struggles through the Great Depression - but a kidnapping gone very wrong leads to Mason exposing a fractured city as he uncovers the truth of the crime. Rhys doesn't carry the intensity of Burr's performance, but folding under the brim of his fedora hat, he certainly looks the part. - Holly Byrnes
